"What are the different dosage levels of tirofiban","The different dosage levels of tirofiban include: (1) Low dose: Bolus of 0.4 microg/kg over 30 minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.10 microg/kg/min, (2) Intermediate dose: Bolus of 10 microg/kg over 3 minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.15 microg/kg/min, (3) High dose: Bolus of 25 microg/kg over 3 minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.15 microg/kg/min",Target-20210689,drugbank-drug.csv
"Which patient group may benefit the most from the high-dose administration of tirofiban?","Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may benefit the most from the high-dose administration of tirofiban",Target-20210689,drugbank-drug.csv
"How does tirofiban inhibit platelet aggregation?","Tirofiban is a reversible antagonist of fibrinogen binding to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, which is the major platelet surface receptor involved in platelet aggregation.",Target-20210689,drugbank-drug_pharmacology.csv
"what is its effect when Tirofiban is administered intravenously according to the recommended regimen?","When administered intravenously, tirofiban inhibits ex vivo platelet aggregation in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. When given according to the recommended regimen, it achieves >90% inhibition by the end of the 30-minute infusion.",Target-20210689,drugbank-drug_pharmacology.csv
"For which two medical conditions has pramipexole received FDA approval, and what is the recommended dosage for one of these conditions?","Pramipexole has been FDA-approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). For RLS, a single oral dose of 0.125 to 0.750 mg, taken 2 to 3 hours before bedtime, is usually effective in controlling sensory symptoms and motor signs.",Target-18248314,drugbank-drug.csv
"What is the mechanism by which pramipexole alleviates the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease","Pramipexole acts as a non-ergot dopamine agonist, selectively binding to D2 dopamine receptors with a preference for D3 receptor subtypes. In Parkinson’s disease, pramipexole stimulates dopamine receptors in the striatum, a brain region responsible for motor control. Since Parkinson’s symptoms are linked to dopamine deficiency in the substantia nigra, pramipexole helps restore dopaminergic function, alleviating motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.",Target-18248314,drugbank-drug_pharmacology.csv
"What is the mechanism by which pramipexole alleviates the symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)?","Pramipexole acts as a non-ergot dopamine agonist, selectively binding to D2 dopamine receptors with a preference for D3 receptor subtypes. In Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), pramipexole is believed to restore balance to the dopaminergic system, reducing unpleasant lower extremity sensations and the urge to move the legs. The exact cause of RLS is unclear, but dysfunction in dopamine signaling is thought to play a major role.",Target-18248314,drugbank-drug_pharmacology.csv
