OBJECTIVES: In this paper we investigated the effect of indomethacin, acetazolamide and their combination in vitro and in vivo on carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes.
METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo.
RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.
