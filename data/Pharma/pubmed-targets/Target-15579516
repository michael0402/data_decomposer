Interrupting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with a usual daily dose of a single-site RAS inhibitor does not achieve complete and long-lasting pharmacologic blockade. Hormonal and BP effects were compared for 48 h after administration of single oral doses of 300 mg (high dose) of the renin inhibitor aliskiren (A300) and 160 mg (standard antihypertensive dose) of the AT1 receptor antagonist valsartan (V160) and their combination each at half dose (A150+V80) in 12 mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, four-period crossover study, A300 decreased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I and II levels for 48 h, stimulated immunoreactive active renin release more strongly than V160, and decreased urinary aldosterone excretion for a longer duration than V160. In contrast to V160, the A150+V80 combination did not increase plasma angiotensins. The renin and aldosterone effects of the A150+V80 combination were similar to those of A300 and greater than those of V160. When plasma drug concentrations were taken into account, the A150 +V80 combination had a synergistic effect on renin release. The A150+V80 combination lowered BP at least as effectively as either higher dose monotherapy. In conclusion, in mildly sodium-depleted normotensive individuals, the long-lasting effects of aliskiren alone or in combination with valsartan on plasma immunoreactive active renin and urinary aldosterone effects demonstrate strong and prolonged blockade of angiotensin II at the kidney and the adrenal level. Moreover, a renin inhibitor and AT1R antagonist combination may provide synergistic effects on RAS hormone levels.
