Leflunomide, a new immunomodulatory agent, was prescribed to a 67-year-old female patient with rheumatoid arthritis. Fifteen days later she developed diarrhoea and elevated liver enzymes. A liver biopsy showed a pattern of acute hepatitis. The patient was homozygous for the rare CYP2C9*3 allele, which determines the slowest metabolic rate for CYP2C9 enzymatic activity, that is probably involved in the metabolism of leflunomide. Liver damage subsided in few weeks. This case illustrates the risk of hepatotoxicity by leflunomide and suggests that it is possibly related to CYP2C9 polymorphism.
