Infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis and X-ray powder diffraction show that the product of 30 min of reaction of haematin in 4.5 M acetate, pH 4.5 at 60 degrees C is identical to beta-haematin prepared in 4.5 M acetic acid at 70 degrees C overnight (pH 2.6). There is no evidence for formation of haem-acetate complex, which could not be isolated, even from 11.4 M acetate solution. The antimalarial drugs quinidine, halofantrine, desbutylhalofantrine and mefloquine were found to inhibit formation of beta-haematin, while 5-, 6- and 8-aminoquinoline and quinoline were found to have no effect. Quinidine was shown to form a complex with ferriprotoporphyrin IX in 40% DMSO with log K = 5.02 +/- 0.03. Log K values for halofantrine and desbutylhalofantrine are 5.29 +/- 0.02 and 5.15 +/- 0.02 respectively (solutions containing 30% acetonitrile in addition to DMSO to solubilise these drugs), which are both stronger than chloroquine under the same conditions (log K = 4.56 +/- 0.02).
