Contraceptive use often leads to disrupted endometrial bleeding patterns in women. In this study, two different contraceptive regimes (Mircette, a monophasic oral contraceptive and Implanon, a long-acting gestagen) were used and their effects on the immunoreactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and endothelial cell number were determined. During the untreated normal cycle, there was a significant increase (P = 0.005) in glandular VEGF immunoreactivity and a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in PR immunoreactivity in the mid- and late secretory phases compared with the proliferative phase. There was a significant positive correlation (gamma = 0.38, P = 0.046) between stromal VEGF immunoreactivity and endothelial cell number. This correlation was also apparent during treatment with Implanon, but not with Mircette. Disrupted bleeding patterns were associated with Implanon and, to a lesser extent, with Mircette. Both contraceptives significantly reduced glandular VEGF immunoreactivity. Implanon significantly increased (P = 0.016) glandular PR staining, but Mircette significantly reduced (P = 0.027) stromal PR staining when compared with secretory before-treatment biopsies. There were no changes in endothelial cell number or glandular or stromal ER during the normal cycle, or with use of either contraceptive. There was no association between the parameters measured with bleeding patterns and histological category.
