The multi-drug resistance gene ABCB1 (or MDR1) encodes a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that regulates passage of many substances across the blood-brain barrier. The antidepressant amitriptyline and its metabolites (including nortriptyline) are substrates for P-gp, and in mice lacking P-gp, penetration of amitriptyline, but not fluoxetine, into the brain is enhanced. We reasoned that polymorphic variation of P-gp may contribute to differing responses of patients to antidepressant drugs. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ABCB1 (3435C>T) was recently correlated with expression levels and in vivo function of P-gp. We examined this SNP in patients with major depression enrolled in a randomized antidepressant treatment trial of nortriptyline and fluoxetine, and observed a significant association between nortriptyline-induced postural hypotension and 3435C>T (chi(2) = 6.78, df = 2, P = 0.034). Our results suggest that homozygosity for 3435T alleles of ABCB1 is a risk factor for occurrence of nortriptyline-induced postural hypotension (OR = 1.37, P = 0.042, 95% CI 1.01-1.86).
