Pyrosequencing was used to detect rapidly and estimate the number of 23S rRNA genes with a G2576T mutation in 43 linezolid-resistant and -susceptible clinical isolates of enterococci. The method showed 100% concordance with PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism for detecting isolates homozygous for either G2576 or T2576 or heterozygous for this mutation. A good correlation was found between linezolid MICs and the number of 23S rRNA gene copies carrying the mutation.
