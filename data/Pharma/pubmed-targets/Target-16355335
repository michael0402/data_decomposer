Molecular detection was compared with the mouse footpad inoculation test for detection of dapsone resistance in 38 strains of Mycobacterium leprae. Mutations of the folP1 gene (at codons 53 or 55) were found in 6 of 6 strains with high-level resistance, in 3 of 4 strains with intermediate-level resistance, and in 1 of 6 strains with low-level resistance, but not in 22 dapsone-susceptible strains. In cases of infection with strains of M. leprae carrying the folP1 mutation, therapy with dapsone may be replaced by therapy with a fluoroquinolone.
