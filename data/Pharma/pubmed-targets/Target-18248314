Pramipexole is a non-ergoline dopamine agonist with a high selectivity for D(2) and D(3) receptors. Initially approved for Parkinson's disease, it was approved by the FDA and EMEA in 2006 for the treatment of idiopathic restless legs syndrome in adults. A single oral dose of pramipexole of between 0.125 and 0.750 mg, taken 2 - 3 h before bedtime, is usually able to control sensory symptoms and motor signs of restless legs syndrome. In clinical practice, tailoring pramipexole treatment based on demographic and clinical characteristics of patients is recommended. In addition, pramipexole seems to be safe and well tolerated. Augmentation, the most common side effect of levodopa, is less prevalent after treatment with pramipexole. In addition, the recurrence of unpleasant symptoms due to pramipexole is uncommon.
