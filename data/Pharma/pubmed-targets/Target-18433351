BACKGROUND: Zonisamide (ZNS), a sulphonamide derivative, is a new-generation anticonvulsant with multiple potential mechanisms that contribute to its antiepileptic efficacy and may also explain its as yet incompletely assessed utility for non-seizure disorders such as headaches, neuropathic pain, and weight loss.
OBJECTIVE: A review of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, evidence for efficacy in different seizure types and non-seizure conditions, adverse effects, and tolerability of ZNS is presented.
METHODS: A review of all manuscripts published in the English literature on ZNS was performed in preparing this manuscript.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: ZNS has a broad label for use in Japan, while the regulatory bodies in the USA and Europe have approved it for use only as an adjunctive therapy for partial seizures in adults. It has favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics, proven efficacy in seizure disorders, and is well tolerated in long-term use.
