The centrally acting muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine decreases the amplitude of monosynaptic reflex potentials by inhibiting the facilitatory descending serotonergic influences in the spinal cord. Interestingly, the structure of cyclobenzaprine is much similar to those of amitriptyline and cyproheptadine. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between 5-HT(2) receptor antagonistic and inhibitory effects of cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, cyproheptadine and ketanserin on the spinal reflexes. Cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, cyproheptadine, and ketanserin significantly inhibited facilitatory effects of 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) on flexor reflexes and mono- and polysynaptic spinal reflex potentials in spinalized rats. In intact rats, these drugs significantly reduced the mono- and polysynaptic reflex potentials. 5-HT depletion significantly prevented the depression of the spinal reflex potentials induced by these drugs. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, and cyproheptadine on mono- and polysynaptic reflex potentials are due to the inhibition of descending serotonergic systems through 5-HT(2) receptors in the spinal cord.
