The protein binding of nifedipine in concentrations up to 1200 ng ml-1 has been measured in serum, pure human albumin solution and pure human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) solutions by ultrafiltration. The drug was extensively bound in serum from four healthy volunteers with a mean (+/- s.d.) fraction bound of 0.992 +/- 0.008. In albumin solution (40 g litre-1) the mean (+/- s.d.) fraction bound 0.970 +/- 0.012, was not significantly different (P greater than 0.05) from that in serum, suggesting that albumin is the major, but not necessarily the only, binding protein for nifedipine in serum. The binding of nifedipine in solutions of AAG was proportional to the AAG concentration and ranged from 0.514 +/- 0.059 to 0.755 +/- 0.035 in solutions containing 50 and 150 mg % AAG, respectively. Binding of nifedipine in all protein solutions was linear.
