This randomized, open-label, crossover study was conducted to investigate whether the coadministration of zafirlukast would affect the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin, clarithromycin, or 14-hydroxyclarithromycin (14-OHC). Twelve healthy subjects (six males and six females) received single 500-mg doses of azithromycin and clarithromycin with and without zafirlukast given to a steady-state concentration. Blood was collected prior to all macrolide doses and for 3 and 10 days after each clarithromycin and azithromycin dose, respectively. Serum was assayed for azithromycin, clarithromycin, and 14-OHC concentrations by validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay systems. Data analyses were done by noncompartmental and nonparametric methods. Analysis of the patients indicated that the addition of steady-state concentrations of zafirlukast did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic parameters of or overall exposure (based on the area under the concentration-time curve) to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and 14-OHC. While zafirlukast is a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, it does not appear to exert a clinically or statistically significant pharmacokinetic effect on azithromycin, clarithromycin, or 14-OHC.
