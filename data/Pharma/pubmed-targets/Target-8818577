Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is a muscle relaxant, possessing a tricyclic structure. Numerous therapeutic agents containing this structure are known to be metabolized by polymorphic cytochrome P4502D6. The aim of this study was to determine if cytochrome P4502D6 and other isoforms are involved in the metabolism of cyclobenzaprine in human liver microsomes. Selective cytochrome P450 inhibitors for CYP1A1/2 (furafylline and 7,8-benzoflavone) and CYP3A4 (troleandomycin, gestodene, and ketoconazole) inhibited the formation of desmethylcyclobenzaprine, a major metabolite of cyclobenzaprine, in human liver microsomes. Antibodies directed against CYP1A1/2 and CYP3A4 inhibited the demethylation reaction whereas anti-human CYP2C9/10, CYP2C19, and CYP2E1 antibodies did not show any inhibitory effects. When a panel of microsomes prepared from human B-lymphoblastoid cells that expressed specific human cytochrome P450 isoforms were used, only microsomes containing cytochromes P4501A2, 2D6, and 3A4 catalyzed N-demethylation. In addition, demethylation catalyzed by these recombinant cytochromes P450 can be completely inhibited with selective inhibitors at concentrations as low as 1 to 20 microM. Interestingly, cyclobenzaprine N-demethylation was significantly correlated with caffeine 3-demethylation (1A2) and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation (3A4) but not with dextromethorphan O-demethylation (2D6) in human liver microsomes. To further determine the involvement of cytochrome P4502D6 in cyclobenzaprine metabolism, liver microsomes from a human that lacked CYP2D6 enzyme activities was included in this study. The data showed that cyclobenzaprine N-demethylation still occurred in the incubation with this microsome. These results suggested that cytochrome P4502D6 plays only a minor role in cyclobenzaprine N-demethylation whereas 3A4 and 1A2 are primarily responsible for cyclobenzaprine metabolism in human liver microsomes. Due to the minimum involvement of CYP2D6 in the vitro metabolism of cyclobenzaprine, the polymorphism of cytochrome P4502D6 in man should not be of muci concern in the clinical use of cyclobenzaprine.
