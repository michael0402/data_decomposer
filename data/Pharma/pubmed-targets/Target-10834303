We studied mefloquine metabolism in cells and microsomes isolated from human and animal (monkey, dog, rat) livers. In both hepatocytes and microsomes, mefloquine underwent conversion to two major metabolites, carboxymefloquine and hydroxymefloquine. In human cells and microsomes these metabolites only were formed, as already demonstrated in vivo, while in other species several unidentified metabolites were also detected. After a 48 hr incubation with human and rat hepatocytes, metabolites accounted for 55-65% of the initial drug concentration, whereas in monkey and dog hepatocytes, mefloquine was entirely metabolized after 15 and 39 hrs, respectively. The consumption of mefloquine was less extensive in microsomes, and unchanged drug represented 60% (monkey) to 85-100% (human, dog, rat) of the total radioactivity after 5 hr incubations. The involvement of the cytochrome P450 3A subfamily in mefloquine biotransformation was suggested by several lines of evidence. Firstly, mefloquine metabolism was strongly increased in hepatic microsomes from dexamethasone-pretreated rats, and also in human and rat hepatocytes after prior treatment with a cytochrome P450 3A inducer. Secondly, mefloquine biotransformation in rifampycin-induced human hepatocytes was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor ketoconazole and thirdly, a strong correlation was found between erythromycin-N-demethylase activity (mediated by cytochrome P450 3A) and mefloquine metabolism in human microsomes (r=0.81, P < 0.05, N=13). Collectively, these findings concerning the role of cytochrome P450 3A in mefloquine metabolism may have important in vivo consequences especially with regard to the choice of agents used in multidrug antimalarial regimens.
