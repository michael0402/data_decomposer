OBJECTIVES: The salicylate mesalazine is commonly used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases, yet its precise mechanism of action is unknown. Because transcription factor NF-kappaB plays an important role in inflammatory bowel diseases, we investigated the effects of mesalazine therapy on NF-kappaB activation in patients with ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: A total of 20 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis received mesalazine for 8 wk. Biopsies were taken before and after drug administration and analyzed for NF-kappaB activation using an antibody specific for active NF-kappaB.
RESULTS: In biopsies of active ulcerative colitis but not in noninflamed mucosa, activation of NF-kappaB was detected predominantly in macrophages. Mesalazine therapy resulted, in a strong abrogation of NF-kappaB activation in situ.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the therapeutic properties of mesalazine rely at least in part on the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, resulting in the suppression of proinflammatory gene expression in the inflamed mucosa.
