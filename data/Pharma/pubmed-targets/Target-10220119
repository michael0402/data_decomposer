Nefazodone, an antidepressant which blocks serotonin (5-HT)2 receptors and 5-HT reuptake, was evaluated in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in six open-label studies involving both civilians and combat veterans. Our objective was to report this available pooled data to characterize the response of this drug in PTSD. Specifically, we looked at response rates using three different criteria, the effect of nefazodone on each PTSD cluster and individual symptoms and, lastly, variables that might predict response. One hundred and five outpatients with chronic PTSD were treated with nefazodone titrated up to 600 mg/day, 92 of whom were entered in an intent to treat analysis. We used the percentage drop in score between baseline and endpoint on main scale as a common measure to evaluate outcome. The response criterion of a drop in score of at least 30%, 40% and 50% revealed response rates of 46, 36 and 26%, respectively. Nefazodone showed a broad spectrum of action on PTSD symptoms. This profile might make nefazodone a useful drug to treat PTSD. Predictors of response include age, sex and trauma type. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in PTSD are in progress to assess the utility of nefazodone as a treatment in this disorder.
