BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of the topical carbonic anhydrase-II-inhibitor dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) in regarding to behaviour of intraocular eyepressure after Nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out as a double-blind-test. In a period of nine months, 120 patients underwent Nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy. One group was given dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt), the other group (placebo) remained without medication. The intraocular pressure was measured before capsulotomy and four hours post-op. For statistical evaluation the t-test of not-associated spot-checks was performed.
RESULTS: The prophylactic use of the topical carbonic anhydrase-II-inhibitor dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) after nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy shows a highly significant lowering of intraocular pressure, i.e. 1.09 mm Hg in the average.
CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that a single dose of dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) after Nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy could lower intraocular pressure significantly. Prophylactical usage of dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) is a useful method to prevent the increase of intraocular pressure and thus to protect the eye against hazardous damage.
