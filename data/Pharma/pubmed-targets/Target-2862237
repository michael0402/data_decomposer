The plasma protein binding of the alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agent prazosin was investigated by means of circular dichroism (CD) and equilibrium dialysis (ED) measurements. The interaction of prazosin with human alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) results in pronounced negative extrinsic Cotton effects at 255 nm and a smaller negative band at 285 nm which are associated with the binding of prazosin to only one site of the protein. Various basic drugs, and warfarin also, at 50 microM displace prazosin 10 microM from its binding site on alpha 1-AGP and reduce the CD-spectra at 255 nm by 26% (disopyramide), 52% (mepivacaine), about 70% (verapamil, biperiden), and 90-100% (trihexyphenidyl, warfarin). (+/-)-Propranolol reduces the CD-spectra by 76%, its (-)-isomer by 89%, and the (+)-isomer by 65%. ED experiments indicated that the binding of prazosin to alpha 1-AGP is saturable with an association constant of 48 000 M-1 and 0.85 binding sites per protein molecule. Displacement of prazosin from alpha 1-AGP by the same drug as used for the CD experiments at displacer/prazosin ratios of 5 resulted in comparable reductions of the fraction bound as obtained by the CD experiments. Prazosin was also highly bound to human serum albumin (600 microM) with about 80-85% bound at prazosin concentrations from 1-100 microM. Since prazosin binding to human serum is only slightly higher (80-90%) it is concluded that prazosin binding in serum is largely mediated by the albumin fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
