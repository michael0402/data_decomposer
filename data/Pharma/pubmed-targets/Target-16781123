The objective of this study was to analyse an array of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin derivatives in order to determine those with good activity against bacteria that already present fluoroquinolone resistance associated with mutations in the gyrA and/or parC genes. Four norfloxacin and 20 ciprofloxacin derivatives were synthesised and tested against quinolone-susceptible and -resistant Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus strains using a microdilution test. Among the derivatives, the 4-methyl-7-piperazine ciprofloxacin derivative showed a minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms that was 16- and 8-fold lower than ciprofloxacin for A. baumannii and S. maltophilia, respectively. When the methyl group at position 4 in the piperazine ring was substituted by ethyl, butyl or heptyl groups, activity against A. baumannii steadily decreased. The 7-(4-methyl)-piperazine ciprofloxacin derivative (UB-8902) showed very good activity against these multiresistant microorganisms including A. baumannii and S. maltophilia.
