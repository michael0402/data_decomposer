The interactions of etretinate and its main metabolite acitretin with human plasma proteins have been investigated in vitro by an erythrocyte partitioning technique that allows a quantitative estimation of the plasma and erythrocyte binding. Etretinate was extensively lipoprotein-bound (75% of plasma etretinate), with a binding constant for its main low density lipoprotein carrier of 40 x 10(6) M-1, accounting for 48% of the total plasma-bound drug. Acitretin was mainly albumin-bound (91% of plasma acitretin), with a binding constant of 0.7 x 10(6) M-1. The total plasma binding of both drugs was > 99% and, in blood, the fractions associated with erythrocytes were 14.5 and 8.1% of the total amount for etretinate and acitretin, respectively.
