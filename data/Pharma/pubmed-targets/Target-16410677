Cabergoline is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clarithromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein and is often co-administered with cabergoline in usual clinical practice. We studied the effect of clarithromycin co-administration on the blood concentration of cabergoline in healthy male volunteers and in PD patients. Study 1: Ten healthy male volunteers were enrolled and were randomized to take a single oral dose of cabergoline (1 mg/day) for 6 days or a single oral dose of cabergoline plus clarithromycin (400 mg/day) for 6 days. Study 2: Seven PD patients receiving stable cabergoline doses were enrolled. They were evaluated for the plasma cabergoline concentration before and after the addition of clarithromycin 400 mg/day for 6 days, and again 1 month after discontinuation of clarithromycin. The dose and duration of clarithromycin were decided according to usual clinical practice. In healthy male volunteers, mean Cmax and AUC(0-10 h) of cabergoline increased to a similar degree during co-administration of clarithromycin. Mean plasma cabergoline concentration over 10 h post-dosing increased 2.6-fold with clarithromycin co-administration. In PD patients, plasma cabergoline concentration increased 1.7-fold during clarithromycin co-administration. Co-administration with clarithromycin may increase the blood concentration of cabergoline in healthy volunteers and in PD patients.
