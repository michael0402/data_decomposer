We performed a drug repurposing screening of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug compound library and identified Anagrelide (ANA), a known phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) inhibitor, that selectively and potently inhibited the growth of cancer cells. However, inactivation of PDE3A or knocking-down its gene expression did not inhibit cancer cell growth. It was the interaction of ANA with PDE3A that created a new function of PDE3A to alter the activities of another unknown function protein SLFN12 to cause the inhibition of cancer cell growth. The expressions of both PDE3A and SLFN12 were required for ANA to inhibit cancer cell growth. Depletion of PDE3A or SLFN12 led to ANA resistance. Furthermore, the effects of ANA on different cancer cells were different depending on the expression levels of PDE3A and SLFN12, causing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in the cells expressing lower levels of SLFN12, but apoptosis in the cells expressing higher levels of the two proteins. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of the ANA-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis identified a set of cell cycle and apoptosis-related genes whose expressions were altered by ANA treatment. ANA also synergized with the cell death-inducing cytokines IFN-α, IFN-γ, TNF-α, or TRAIL, which regulated the same set of genes as ANA did, to induce apoptosis of the cancer cells. Our study uncovered new activities, functions, and mechanisms of ANA and SLFN12 and provided a diagnosis method to precisely use ANA as an anti-cancer drug. It also revealed PDE3A and SLFN12 as new anti-cancer drug targets for developing novel anti-cancer therapies.
