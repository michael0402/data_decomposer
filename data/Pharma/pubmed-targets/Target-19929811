The diltiazem binding site of L-type calcium channels is the least characterized to date. In this paper, we present some of the available chemotypes that bind to the benzothiazepine binding site: natural compounds, compounds synthesized by varying the benzothiazepine scaffold, and compounds discovered by means of computational approaches.
