Perindopril is a third-generation ACE inhibitor that is characterised as a small, lipophilic molecule with a therapeutically active carboxyl side group. These and other features combine to make this a unique member of a very well-established class of drugs that have proven efficacy in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) demonstrated benefit in the secondary prevention of patients with stroke, whereas the Perindopril and Remodelling in Elderly with Acute Myocardial Infarction (PREAMI) trial supports extended routine use after myocardial infarction. The most recent evidence from the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA) and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) show that perindopril is able to improve the prognosis of patients with a relatively low global cardiovascular risk, denoted either by the presence of stable coronary artery disease or of essential hypertension in conjunction with at least three other risk factors. The fact that major relative risk reductions have been reported for these two studies is matched by the significance of the findings to modern clinical practice. Both studies were conducted in the context of advance concomitant care that is typically better in clinical trials than in routine practice. In particular, the benefits observed were seen to be of a similar magnitude, and also independent of those resulting from statin therapy. Of particular interest is the likely complimentary action of these treatment strategies with regard to the stabilisation of atheromatous plaques. Perindopril is a well-established drug, the full value of which is only now becoming fully apparent.
