OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Jingui Shenqi Pill (JSP) on the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the skin lesion and its clinical effect in treating bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients.
METHODS: Thirty BP patients were randomly divided into the treatment group (n=15) treated with JSP plus prednisone and the prednisone group (n=15) with prednisone alone both for 4 weeks. And a normal control group was set up also. Expressions of GR-alpha and GR-beta in the skin lesion of BP patients and the normal skin of the normal control were detected by immunohistochemical assay. Results The total effective rate was 93.33% in the treatment group, significantly higher than that in the prednisone group which was 73.33% (P < 0.05); GR-alpha expression was higher in the treatment group than that in other two groups (P < 0.01), while GR-beta expression in the treatment group was lower than that in the prednisone group (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: JSP could increase GR-alpha expression and decrease GR-beta expression in the skin lesion of BP patients, so as to improve sensitivity of skin to glucocorticoid.
