CYP2C9 is an important member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily, and 57 cytochrome P450 2C9 alleles have been previously reported. To examine the enzymatic activity of the CYP2C9 alleles, kinetic parameters for 4'-hydroxyflurbiprofen were determined using recombinant human P450s CYP2C9 microsomes from insect cells Sf21 carrying wild-type CYP2C9*1 and other variants. The results showed that the enzyme activity of most of the variants decreased comparing with the wild type as the previous studies reported, while the enzyme activity of some of them increased, which were not in accordance with the previous researches. Of the 36 tested CYP2C9 allelic isoforms, two variants (CYP2C9*53 and CYP2C9*56) showed a higher intrinsic clearance value than the wild-type protein, especially for CYP2C9*56, exhibited much higher intrinsic clearance (197.3%) relative to wild-type CYP2C9*1, while the remaining 33 CYP2C9 allelic isoforms exhibited significantly decreased clearance values (from 0.6 to 83.8%) compared to CYP2C9*1. This study provided the most comprehensive data on the enzymatic activities of all reported CYP2C9 variants in the Chinese population with regard to the commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, flurbiprofen (FP). The results indicated that most of the tested rare alleles decreased the catalytic activity of CYP2C9 variants toward FP hydroxylation in vitro. This is the first report of all these rare alleles for FP metabolism providing fundamental data for further clinical studies on CYP2C9 alleles for FP metabolism in vivo.
