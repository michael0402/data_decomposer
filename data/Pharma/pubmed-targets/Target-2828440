A screening program for antiviral drugs begun at Burroughs Wellcome in the 1960s resulted in the discovery of acyclovir in 1974. Preclinical investigation brought the drug to clinical trials in 1977 and the first form of the drug (topical) was available to physicians in 1982. Activity of acyclovir is greatest against herpes 1 and herpes 2, less against varicella zoster, still less against Epstein-Barr, and very little against cytomegalovirus. Acyclovir is an antiviral agent only after it is phosphorylated in infected cells by a viral-induced thymidine kinase. Acyclovir monophosphate is phosphorylated to diphosphate and triphosphate forms by cellular enzymes in the infected host cell where the drug is concentrated. Acyclovir triphosphate inactivates viral deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase. Acyclovir incorporation into the growing viral deoxyribonucleic acid chain causes its termination. The antiviral process has relatively little effect on normal, uninfected cells. An important toxic effect of acyclovir is its potential to cause obstructive nephropathy. The drug is excreted primarily by the kidney, which may require smaller doses in patients with decreased kidney function. Oral dosages of acyclovir as recommended for herpes simplex are probably not adequate for varicella zoster infections.
