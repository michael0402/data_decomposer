In this study we have expanded the metabolic potential of plant cell suspension cultures by introducing active human cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 3A4 into tobacco cells. Exogenously supplied loratadine was metabolized in a 3A4-specific manner, showing the capacity of this system for the generation of metabolites.
