A dihydropyridine-affinity column was prepared by coupling a physiologically active and vasoselective amino-derivative of felodipine to divinylsulfone-activated Trisacryl GF2000. Calmodulin (CaM) as well as the homologous calcium-binding proteins skeletal and cardiac Troponin C (sTnC and cTnC) and S100b bound to this resin in a calcium-dependent manner. In contrast, other homologous proteins such as parvalbumin and the intestinal calcium-binding protein did not bind. Competition studies showed that CaM had a higher affinity for the felodipine-column than sTnC or cTnC. Through studies with a series of proteolytic fragments of CaM and sTnC, it was found that the felodipine binding site is located in the amino-terminal domain of the protein. These results illustrate the utility of affinity-chromatography for the study of dihydropyridine-binding proteins.
