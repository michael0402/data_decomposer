In renal proximal tubules, the organic cation transporters rOCT1 and rOCT2 are supposed to mediate the first step in organic cation secretion. We investigated whether previously described differences in amantadine and tetraethylammonium (TEA) uptake into isolated renal proximal tubules could be explained by differences in their transport by rOCT1 and rOCT2. By expressing rOCT1 and rOCT2 in Xenopus oocytes and HEK 293 cells, we demonstrated that both transporters translocated amantadine. In Xenopus oocytes, the inhibitory potency of several rOCT1/2 inhibitors was similar for amantadine compared to TEA uptake and supports amantadine transport by rOCT1 and rOCT2. In proximal tubules, procainamide, quinine, cyanine(863), choline, and guanidine in concentrations that inhibit rOCT1/2-mediated TEA or amantadine uptake in Xenopus oocytes exhibited no effect on amantadine uptake. At variance, these inhibitors blocked TEA uptake into proximal tubules. Amantadine and TEA transport were sensitive to modulation by 25 mM bicarbonate. The effect of bicarbonate on organic cation transport was dependent on substrate (amantadine or TEA), cell system (oocytes, HEK 293 cells, or proximal tubules), and transporter (rOCT1 or rOCT2). In proximal tubules, only amantadine uptake was stimulated by bicarbonate. The data suggested that rat renal proximal tubules contain an organic cation transporter in addition to rOCT1 and rOCT2 that mediates amantadine uptake and requires bicarbonate for optimal function. TEA uptake by the basolateral membrane may be mediated mainly by rOCT1 and rOCT2, but these transporters may be in a different functional or regulatory state when expressed in cells or oocytes compared with expression in vivo.
