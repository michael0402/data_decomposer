Chlorotrianisene (TACE) exhibits in vitro little or no binding to the uterine estrogen receptor (ER) but demonstrates potent estrogenic activity in vivo, indicating that TACE is a proestrogen/proantiestrogen. Our earlier studies demonstrated that the incubation of TACE with rat liver microsomes and NADPH generates a reactive intermediate (T*) which binds covalently to proteins. The current study examined the possibility that T* may inactivate the uterine ER. The incubation of TACE with rat liver microsomes and NADPH in the presence of rat uteri, under conditions which generate T*, markedly decreased the binding capacity of the ER for [3H]estradiol (E2). The evidence indicates that ER inactivation was probably due to irreversible (covalent) binding of T* to the E2 binding site. The possibility that the antiestrogenic action of TACE and of other triphenylethylenes involves such a novel mechanism is discussed.
