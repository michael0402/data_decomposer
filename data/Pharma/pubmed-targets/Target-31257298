Flecainide, an anti-arrhythmic drug, undergoes renal excretion through active renal tubular secretion in addition to passive glomerular filtration. The contribution of renal uptake and efflux transporters in active renal tubular secretion of flecainide remains unclear except that flecainide is a substrate of human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1). To elucidate renal efflux and uptake transporters involved with active renal tubular secretion of flecainide, we conducted in vitro interaction studies of flecainide using organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, and MATE2-K. Uptake transporter inhibition assays using hOCT2-Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), hMATE1-CHO, and hMATE2-K-Madin Darby canine kidney strain II (MDCKII) cells revealed that flecainide (2.5 µM) inhibited hMATE1-mediated transport by 40% with an IC
