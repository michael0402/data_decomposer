Levobunolol is a potent non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent used for the topical treatment of increased intraocular pressure in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In comparative studies of up to 2 years' duration levobunolol 0.5 to 1% reduced intraocular pressures by about 30% and adequately controlled intraocular hypertension in 50 to 85% of those treated. These results were significantly superior to those produced by placebo and comparable to the responses achieved with ocular timolol in double-blind controlled trials. Levobunolol has been well tolerated, producing only minor changes in objective and subjective ophthalmic and systemic parameters. Adverse reactions resulted in approximately 5% of patients withdrawing from treatment with levobunolol which was equivalent to that observed with timolol. Thus, ocular levobunolol is a well-tolerated and effective therapy for the management of raised intraocular pressure, and is a suitable alternative to ocular timolol in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
