The specificities of orphenadrine and methimazole on eight human liver P450 enzyme activities were evaluated by studying the extent of inhibition at different concentrations in two protocols: competitive inhibition and preincubation. In the competitive inhibition protocol, orphenadrine decreased CYP2B6 marker activity up to 45-57% in human liver microsomes and up to 80-97% in cell microsomes containing cDNA-expressed CYP2B6. Orphenadrine strongly decreased CYP2D6 marker activity by 80-90%. Orphenadrine also partially decreased the CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 marker activities. In the preincubation protocol, orphenadrine decreased the CYP2B6 activity in cDNA-expressed cell microsomes to completion. In human liver microsomes, orphenadrine strongly decreased the marker activities of CYP2B6, CYP2D6, as well as CYP2C9; and partially decreased the marker activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19. In the competitive inhibition protocol, methimazole had no effect on the marker activities of CYP2E1 and CYP2A6; slightly decreased CYP2D6 marker activity; partially decreased the marker activities of CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6; and dramatically decreased CYP3A4 marker activity. Methimazole decreased CYP1A2 marker activity at lower concentrations, but not at the highest concentration studied (1 mM). In the preincubation protocol, methimazole was shown to be a potent and nonspecific inhibitor of all the enzyme activities. Marker activities of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 were completely inhibited at relatively low concentrations. This study indicates orphenadrine cannot be used as a selective inhibitor of CYP2B6 in human liver microsomes and that methimazole is not a selective inhibitor of the flavin-containing monooxygenase in human liver microsomes.
