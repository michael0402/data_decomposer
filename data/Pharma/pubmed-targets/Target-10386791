In spite of much work on DNA gyrase and quinolones for many years, our knowledge of the molecular basis of quinolone-gyrase action is still incomplete. We designed a photoaffinity labeling reagent for the quinolone target, and synthesized a norfloxacin analogue with an azide function which, under UV irradiation, becomes covalently linked to its target. For that, a large amount of purified gyrase was needed. Both subunits were purified using exclusion and affinity chromatography. A plasmid was used that allowed the overproduction of GyrA as a fusion-protein with six histidine residues at its carboxy-terminal domain. GyrA-(His)6 was purified after chromatography on a nickel-containing column, and native GyrB after chromatography on immobilized novobiocin. Reconstituted DNA gyrase (A2B2) had supercoiling activity. Photoaffinity labeling showed covalent binding of the 3H-photoaffinity analogue of norfloxacin to the gyrase-DNA complex, and mainly to the GyrA. The specific binding site remains to be explored.
