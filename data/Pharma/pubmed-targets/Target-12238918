N-[3-(1H-Imidazol-4-ylmethyl)phenyl]ethanesulfonamide (ABT-866, 1) is a novel alpha(1) agent having the unique profile of alpha(1A) (rabbit urethra, EC(50) = 0.60 microM) agonism with alpha(1B) (rat spleen, pA(2) = 5.4) and alpha(1D) (rat aorta, pA(2) = 6.2) antagonism. An in vivo dog model showed 1 to be more selective for the urethra over the vasculature than A-61603 (2), ST-1059 (3, the active metabolite of midodrine), and phenylpropanolamine (4).
