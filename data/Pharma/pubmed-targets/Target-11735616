black triangle Frovatriptan, a new serotonin receptor agonist developed for the acute treatment of migraine, has high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor subtypes and is a potent stimulator of contraction in human basilar arteries. black triangle A long terminal elimination half-life (approximately 26 hours) is a distinctive pharmacokinetic feature of frovatriptan which appears to be independent of dose, age, gender and renal function. black triangle A single oral dose of frovatriptan 2.5mg was effective in the acute treatment of migraine providing meaningful relief within 2 hours to approximately twice as many recipients as placebo in clinical trials. black triangle Consistent relief of migraine symptoms was achieved in patients who treated a number of consecutive attacks with frovatriptan and the incidence of 24-hour migraine recurrence was reduced. black triangle Frovatriptan was well tolerated in clinical trials, with the overall incidence of adverse events occurring with frovatriptan 2.5mg only slightly higher than that reported with placebo. Mild to moderate fatigue, nausea and paraesthesia were the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events.
