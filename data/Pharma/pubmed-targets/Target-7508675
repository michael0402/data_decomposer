Risperidone (RIS), a new neuroleptic with 5-HT2- and dopamine D2 receptor-blocking properties, was compared with perphenazine (PER) in a double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group study in 107 chronic schizophrenics with acute exacerbation. RIS 5-15 mg or PER 16-48 mg daily was given for 8 weeks. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression. Seventy-eight patients completed the trial; there was an equal number of dropouts on both drugs. The mean daily dose at endpoint was 8.5 mg RIS and 28 mg PER. The reduction in total PANSS score to endpoint did not differ significantly, although there was a tendency in favour of RIS. The number of patients with predominantly negative symptoms who showed at least 20% reduction in total PANSS score was significantly larger in the RIS group. Furthermore, the number of patients showing at least 20% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score (BPRS being a subscale of PANSS) was significantly larger in the RIS group. The hostility cluster of BPRS improved more on RIS than on PER in the endpoint analysis. The overall prevalence of side effects was fairly similar in the two groups.
