Solifenacin is a novel selective antagonist of M(3) muscarinic receptor developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. The current study was undertaken to characterize in vivo muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity of solifenacin in the bladder and submandibular gland by using muscarinic receptor subtype knockout (KO) mice. Muscarinic receptors in the bladder and submandibular gland of wild type, M(2)R KO and M(3)R KO mice under in vitro and after oral administration of solifenacin and oxybutynin were measured by radioligand binding assay using [N-methyl-(3)H]scopolamine ([(3)H]NMS). There was little difference between the bladder and submandibular gland of M(2)R KO mice in the receptor binding activities of oxybutynin and solifenacin in vitro, suggesting equal affinity for residual (predominantly M(3) subtype) muscarinic receptors in both tissues. In contrast, compared with oral oxybutynin, oral administration of solifenacin exerted a significantly greater activity to bind muscarinic receptors in the bladder of M(2)R KO mice, while exhibiting a significantly less activity to bind those in the submandibular gland. In the bladder and submandibular gland of M(3)R KO mice, the binding activity of solifenacin and oxybutynin showed no significant difference. Plasma concentrations of solifenacin and oxybutynin after oral administration differed little among wild type, M(2)R KO and M(3)R KO mice. The results indicate that oral solifenacin, unlike oral oxybutynin, may selectively bind to the muscarinic M(3) subtype in the bladder compared with such receptors in the submandibular gland in vivo. Oral solifenacin may be advantageous for the treatment of overactive bladder, in terms of high affinity for M(3) receptors in the bladder.
