AIM: We aimed to evaluate the influence of genetic polymorphisms involved in deferasirox metabolism and transport on its pharmacokinetics and treatment toxicity, in a cohort of Î²-thalassaemic children.
PATIENTS & METHODS: Drug plasma concentrations were measured by a HPLC-UV method. Allelic discrimination for UGT1A1, UGT1A3, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, MRP2 and BCRP1 polymorphisms was performed by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: CYP1A1 rs2606345AA influenced C
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the usefulness of deferasirox pharmacogenetics in pediatric treatment optimization.
