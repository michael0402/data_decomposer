We investigated the role of NAT2 on clonazepam acetylation, using transiently expressed human NAT2 alleles. The NAT25*B and the NAT2*6A variant alleles cause a 20 and 22-fold reduction in the Vmax, respectively. We conclude that NAT2 is responsible for 7-aminoclonazepam acetylation and that NAT2 gene polymorphisms impair such metabolic pathway.
