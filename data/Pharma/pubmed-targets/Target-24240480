BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia and acute episodes of mania. Quetiapine is metabolized by CYP3A enzymes including CYP3A5 and is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, an efflux drug transporter encoded by the ABCB1 gene. We assessed the effects of ABCB1 [c.1236C>T (rs1128503), c.2677G>T/A (rs2032582), c.3435C>T (rs1045642)] and CYP3A5*3 (6986A>G) (rs776746) polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty healthy male individuals were enrolled, and their ABCB1 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms were assessed. After a single dose of 100 mg quetiapine was administered, plasma concentrations of quetiapine were measured for 24 h and pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out.
RESULTS: The ABCB1 polymorphisms including c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A, and c.3435C>T did not affect plasma levels of quetiapine, and its pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ among ABCB1 genotype groups. However, the CYP3A5*3 polymorphism significantly affected the plasma level of quetiapine and its pharmacokinetics. The peak plasma concentration of quetiapine was 208.39 ng/ml for CYP3A5*1/*1, 243.46 ng/ml for CYP3A5*1/*3, and 332.94 ng/ml for CYP3A5*3/*3 (P=0.0118). The mean AUC(inf) (area under the time vs. concentration curve from 0 to infinity) value was 627.3, 712.77, and 1045.29 ng h/ml, respectively (P=0.0017).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5*3 but not ABCB1 significantly influences the plasma level of quetiapine and its pharmacokinetics. These findings suggest that the CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism affects the disposition of quetiapine and provide a plausible explanation for interindividual variation in the disposition of this drug.
