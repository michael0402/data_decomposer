Isoniazid (INH), a widely used antituberculosis drug, has been associated with serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI). INH-modified proteins have been proposed to play important roles in INH DILI; however, it remains to be determined whether INH or reactive metabolites bind irreversibly to proteins. In this study, mass spectrometry was used to define protein modifications by INH in vitro and in patients taking INH therapy. When INH was incubated with N-acetyl lysine (NAL), the same isonicotinic-NAL (IN-NAL) adducts were detected irrespective of the presence or absence of any oxidative enzymes, indicating auto-oxidation may have been involved. In addition, we found that INH could also bind to human serum albumin (HSA) via an auto-oxidation pathway, forming isonicotinic amide adducts with lysine residues in HSA. Similar adducts were detected in plasma samples isolated from patients taking INH therapy. Our results show that INH forms protein adducts in the absence of metabolism.
