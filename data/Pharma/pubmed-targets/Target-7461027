The serum protein binding of maprotiline and phenytoin has been compared in a group of 22 uraemic patients receiving haemodialysis. Determination of protein binding was carried out in vitro using equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C and 14C-labelled drug. The mean percentage unbound maprotiline found in patients (10.0%, SD 2.5) was not significantly different from that obtained in healthy volunteers (mean 10.5%, SD 1.0). However, there was a significantly increased variability in binding in patients compared with healthy subjects. The mean percentage unbound phenytoin in the same patients (22.2%, SD 3.3) was significantly greater than that obtained in healthy control subjects (12.5%, SD 0.6). Although there was no correlation between maprotiline and phenytoin binding and serum concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, there was a significant correlation between percentage unbound maprotiline and serum albumin concentrations. The findings indicate that the binding of this tricyclic antidepressant is essentially normal in uraemia, although there may be increased interindividual variability in the free fraction of drug.
