In-vitro data indicated a contribution of cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2, 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 to biotransformation of doxepin. We studied the effects of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 on E- and Z-doxepin pharmacokinetics in humans. Doxepin kinetics was studied after a single oral dose of 75 mg in healthy volunteers genotyped as extensive (EM), intermediate (IM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of substrates of CYP2D6 and of CYP2C19 and as slow metabolizers with the CYP2C9 genotype *3/*3. E-, Z-doxepin and -desmethyldoxepin were quantified in plasma by HPLC. Data were analyzed by non-parametric pharmacokinetics and statistics and by population pharmacokinetic modeling considering effects of genotype on clearance and bioavailability. Mean E-doxepin clearance (95% confidence interval) was 406 (390-445), 247 (241-271), and 127 (124-139) l h(-1) in EMs, IMs and PMs of CYP2D6. In addition, EMs had about 2-fold lower bioavailability compared with PMs indicating significant contribution of CYP2D6 to E-doxepin first-pass metabolism. E-doxepin oral clearance was also significantly lower in carriers of CYP2C9*3/*3 (238 l h(-1) ). CYP2C19 was involved in Z-doxepin metabolism with 2.5-fold differences in oral clearances (73 l h(-1) in CYP2C19 PMs compared with 191 l h(-1) in EMs). The area under the curve (0-48 h) of the active metabolite -desmethyldoxepin was dependent on CYP2D6 genotype with a median of 5.28, 1.35, and 1.28 nmol l h(-1) in PMs, IMs, and EMs of CYP2D6. The genetically polymorphic enzymes exhibited highly stereoselective effects on doxepin biotransformation in humans. The CYP2D6 polymorphism had a major impact on E-doxepin pharmacokinetics and CYP2D6 PMs might be at an elevated risk for adverse drug effects when treated with common recommended doses.
