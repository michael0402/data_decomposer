The antihypertension agent iodoazidoaryl prazosin (IAAP) has been made using a convergent route involving addition of an acylated piperazine 7 to 2-chloroquinazoline 5. IAAP has been shown to function as a multidrug resistance (MDR) reversal agent and bind to P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane transport protein. A study is also reported involving palladium-catalyzed substitution with amine heterocycles. With N,N-bis(2,6-diisopropyl)dihydroimidazolium chloride (10) as the ligand (2 mol %) for palladium(II) acetate (2 mol %) in THF at room temperature, morpholine added to 5 in 81% yield.
