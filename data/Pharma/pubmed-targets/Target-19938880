Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that binds irreversibly and specifically to the proton pump, thereby reducing gastric acid secretion. Pantoprazole has a relatively long duration of action compared with other PPIs, and a lower propensity to become activated in slightly acidic body compartments. To date, no drug-drug interactions have been identified with pantoprazole in numerous interaction studies. Overall, in the short-term (8-10 weeks) initial treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (a condition that occurs when the reflux of gastric contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications) and long-term (6-24 months) maintenance therapy, oral pantoprazole 20 or 40 mg/day demonstrated similar efficacy to omeprazole, lansoprazole and esomeprazole and greater efficacy than histamine type 2 receptor antagonists. Pantoprazole is also effective in treating and preventing NSAID-related gastric and gastroduodenal injury. The optimal adult oral dose for gastric acid-related disorders is pantoprazole 40 mg once daily. Although data are limited, pantoprazole 20 or 40 mg/day was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of acid-related disorders in children and adolescents. Pantoprazole was also well tolerated in adults with acid-related disorders in short- and long-term studies. Thus, pantoprazole is a valuable agent for the management of acid-related disorders.
