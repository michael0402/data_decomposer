Modulations of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems are thought to be critical to the therapeutic effect of most antidepressants, and their efficacies have been shown to depend on a functional polymorphism within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). Mirtazapine has a dual-action profile, combining the enhancement of the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system with specific actions on particular serotonergic receptor subtypes. The goal of this study was to elucidate whether the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with the mirtazapine antidepressant response in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). One hundred and one MDD patients were evaluated during 4 weeks of mirtazapine treatment. The severity of depression was assessed with the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating scale, and the 5-HTTLPR genotypes in the patients were determined using the polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that responses at the 2nd and 4th weeks were significantly better for the s/s genotype of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism than for l-allele carriers. These results support our hypothesis that the response to noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants is significantly associated with the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism.
