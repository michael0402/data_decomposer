Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are strongly bound to human serum albumin (HSA), mainly to sites I and II. The aim of this study was to characterize the binding site(s) of etodolac enantiomers under physiological conditions (580 microM HSA) using equilibrium dialysis. The protein binding of etodolac enantiomers, alone or in various ratios, was studied in order to evaluate the potential competition between them. Our results showed that (S)-etodolac was more strongly bound to HSA than (R)-etodolac. The displacement of one enantiomer by its antipode was observed only at high concentrations of the competitor, and was more pronounced for (S)-form. Displacement studies of the enantiomers by specific probes of sites I and II of albumin, dansylamide, and dansylsarcosine, respectively, showed that (R)-etodolac was slightly displaced by both these probes whereas the free concentration of (S)-etodolac increased markedly in the presence of dansylsarcosine. Moreover, the binding of ligands to sites I and II is usually affected by alkaline pH, by chloride ions, and by fatty acids. For etodolac, the presence of 0.1 and 1 M chloride ions and increasing pH (5.5-9) decreased the binding of both enantiomers. The same result was obtained with addition of octanoic acid. Conversely, the addition of oleic, palmitic, or stearic acid to the protein solution increased the binding of (R)-etodolac, but decreased that of its antipode. All these findings suggest (R)- and (S)-etodolac interact mainly with site II of HSA, and that the (R)-isomer is also bound to site I under physiological conditions.
