Imiquimod is a topical immune response modifier that binds to Toll-like receptor-7 and -8, inducing interferon-alpha. We treated superficial basal cell carcinomas (BCC) with imiquimod 5% cream daily for 5-8 days. The BCC lesions were biopsied before treatment and following imiquimod treatment, when the lesion showed the signs of erosion. We applied histology, immunohistochemistry and gene array technology (Affymetrix) to gain further insight into the mode of action of imiquimod. Our findings demonstrate that imiquimod-induced BCC regression is associated with a strong activity of the innate immune response, mediated by cells of macrophage-monocyte origin and is associated with the induction of apoptosis.
