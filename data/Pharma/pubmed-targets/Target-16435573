Ciclesonide, a novel inhaled corticosteroid, is currently being developed for the treatment of asthma. Here, the enzymes catalysing the human hepatic metabolism of ciclesonide were investigated. When incubated with human liver microsomes (HLM), [14C]ciclesonide was first metabolised to the active metabolite M1 (des-isobutyryl-ciclesonide, des-CIC) and to at least two additional metabolites, M2 and M3. M3 comprises a 'family' of structurally similar metabolites that are inactive. 16-Hydroxyprednisolone was also formed in microsomal incubations of [14C]des-CIC, but at approximately one-tenth the amount of both M2 and M3. bis-p-Nitrophenylphosphate and SKF 525-A respectively inhibited des-CIC formation from [14C]ciclesonide by 82% and 49% and M2/M3 formation by 82-84% and 87-89%. Regression analysis showed significant negative correlations (r = -0.96, -0.79 and -0.71, respectively) of M2 formation with CYP3A4/5, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 activities; M3 formation significantly correlated with CYP4A9/11 (r = 0.47). Troleandomycin and diethyldithiocarbamate inhibited M2 and M3 formation by 85% and 45%, respectively. Sulphaphenazole and quinidine had no inhibitory effects. CYP3A4 Supersomes catalysed notable formation of both M2 and M3 from [14C]des-CIC; CYP2C8 and CYP2D6, but not CYP4A11 formed smaller amounts. It is concluded that the human hepatic metabolism of ciclesonide is primarily catalysed by one or more esterases and, subsequently, by CYP3A4.
