Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (CBH) is a well-known muscle relaxant that is widely used to relieve muscle spasms and other pain associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions. In this study, we elucidated the binding characteristics of this muscle relaxant to human serum albumin (HSA). From a pharmaceutical and biochemical viewpoint, insight into the structure, functions, dynamics, and features of HSA-CBH complex holds great importance. The binding of CBH with this major circulatory transport protein was studied using a combination of biophysical approaches such as UV-VIS absorption, fluorescence quenching, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.
