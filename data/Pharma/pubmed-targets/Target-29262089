None: Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic medication that is used for the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. It is effective against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.Â Nitrofurantoin was approved by the FDA in 1953 for treatment of lower urinary tract infection. Nitrofurantoin is a synthetic antimicrobial created from furan and an added nitro group and a side change containing hydantoin. Nitrofurantoin was widely used the for treatment of lower urinary tract infections until the 1970s when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and newer beta-lactam antibiotics became available. More recently, several major guidelines have declared nitrofurantoin as the first-line therapy for treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections. Increasing resistance to newer antibiotics coinciding with increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria has led to a resurgence in use of nitrofurantoin.[1][2][3][4][5]
