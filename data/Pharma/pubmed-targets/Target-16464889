OBJECTIVES: Mycoplasma hominis is intrinsically resistant to 14- and 15-membered macrolides and to the ketolide telithromycin but is susceptible to josamycin, a 16-membered macrolide, and lincosamides. The aim of our study was to investigate the in vitro development of macrolide resistance in M. hominis and to study the impact of ribosomal mutations on MICs of various macrolides and related antibiotics.
METHODS: Selection of macrolide-resistant mutants was performed by serial passages of M. hominis PG21 in broth medium containing subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin, pristinamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and telithromycin. Stepwise selection of josamycin-resistant mutants was performed onto agar medium containing increasing inhibitory concentrations of josamycin. Resistant mutants were characterized by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of 23S rRNA, L4 and L22 ribosomal protein genes.
RESULTS: Various mutations in domain II or V of 23S rRNA were selected in the presence of each selector antibiotic and were associated with several resistance phenotypes. Josamycin was the sole antibiotic that selected for single amino acid changes in ribosomal proteins L4 and L22. Unexpectedly, the C2611U transition selected in the presence of clindamycin and the quinupristin/dalfopristin combination was associated with decreased MICs of erythromycin, azithromycin and telithromycin, leading to a loss of the intrinsic resistance of M. hominis to erythromycin and azithromycin.
CONCLUSIONS: Ribosomal mutations were associated with resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics in M. hominis. Some mutants showed a loss of the intrinsic resistance to erythromycin and azithromycin.
