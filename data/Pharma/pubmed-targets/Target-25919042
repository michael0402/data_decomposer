AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) c.428G > A (p.G143E, rs71647871) single nucleotide variation (SNV) on the pharmacokinetics of quinapril and enalapril in a prospective genotype panel study in healthy volunteers.
METHODS: In a fixed-order crossover study, 10 healthy volunteers with the CES1 c.428G/A genotype and 12 with the c.428G/G genotype ingested a single 10 mg dose of quinapril and enalapril with a washout period of at least 1 week. Plasma concentrations of quinapril and quinaprilat were measured for up to 24 h and those of enalapril and enalaprilat for up to 48 h. Their excretion into the urine was measured from 0 h to 12 h.
RESULTS: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC0-∞) of active enalaprilat was 20% lower in subjects with the CES1 c.428G/A genotype than in those with the c.428G/G genotype (95% confidence interval of geometric mean ratio 0.64, 1.00; P = 0.049). The amount of enalaprilat excreted into the urine was 35% smaller in subjects with the CES1 c.428G/A genotype than in those with the c.428G/G genotype (P = 0.044). The CES1 genotype had no significant effect on the enalaprilat to enalapril AUC0-∞ ratio or on any other pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters of enalapril or enalaprilat. The CES1 genotype had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters of quinapril.
CONCLUSIONS: The CES1 c.428G > A SNV decreased enalaprilat concentrations, probably by reducing the hydrolysis of enalapril, but had no observable effect on the pharmacokinetics of quinapril.
