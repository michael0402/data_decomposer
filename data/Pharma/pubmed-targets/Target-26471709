Human serum albumin (HSA)-drug binding is an important factor to determine half life and bioavailability of drugs. In the present research, the interaction of sertraline (SER) to HSA was investigated using combination of spectroscopic and molecular modeling techniques. Changes in the UV-Vis, CD and FT-IR spectra as well as a significant degree of tryptophan fluorescence quenching were observed upon SER-HSA interaction. Data obtained by spectroscopic methods along with the computational studies suggest that SER binds to residues located in subdomain IIA of HSA. Analysis of spectroscopic data represented the formation of 1:1 complex, significant binding affinity, negative values of entropy and enthalpy changes and the essential role of hydrophobic interactions in binding of SER to HSA. The binding models were demonstrated in the aspects of SER's conformation, active site interactions, important amino acids and hydrogen bonding. Computational mapping of the possible binding site of SER confirmed that the ligand to be bound in a large hydrophobic cavity of HSA. In accordance with experimental data, computational analyses indicated that SER binding does not alter the secondary structure of the protein. The results not only lead to a better understanding of interaction between SER and HSA but also provide useful data about the influence of SER on the protein conformation.
