INTRODUCTION: We evaluated chr6q25.3 organic cation transporter gene (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3) variation and response to smoking cessation therapies. The corresponding proteins are low-affinity transporters of choline, acetylcholine and monoamines, and smoking cessation pharmacotherapies expressed in multiple tissues.
METHODS: We selected 7 common polymorphisms for mega-regression analysis. We assessed additive model association of polymorphisms with 7-day point prevalence abstinence overall and by assigned pharmacotherapy at end of treatment and at 6 months among European-ancestry participants of 7 randomized controlled trials adjusted for demographic, population genetic, and trial covariates.
RESULTS: Initial results were obtained in 6 trials with 1,839 participants. Nominally statistically significant associations of 2 SLC22A2 polymorphisms were observed: (1) with rs316019 at 6 months, overall ([c.808T>G; p.Ser270Ala], OR = 1.306, 95% CI = 1.034-1.649, p = .025), and among those randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (OR = 1.784, 95% CI = 1.072-2.970, p = .026); and (2) with rs316006 (c.1502-529A>T) among those randomized to varenicline (OR = 1.420, 95% CI = 1.038-1.944, p = .028, OR = 1.362, 95% CI = 1.001-1.853, p = .04) at end of treatment and 6 months. Individuals randomized to NRT from a seventh trial were genotyped for rs316019; rs316019 was associated with a nominally statistically significant effect on abstinence overall at 6 months among 2,233 participants (OR = 1.249, 95% CI = 1.007-1.550, p = .043).
CONCLUSIONS: The functional OCT2 Ser270Ala polymorphism is nominally statistically significantly associated with abstinence among European-ancestry treatment-seeking smokers after adjustments for pharmacotherapy, demographics, population genetics, and without adjustment for multiple testing of 7 SNPs. Replication of these preliminary findings in additional randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation therapies and from multiple continental populations would describe another pharmacogenetic role for SLC22A2/OCT2.
