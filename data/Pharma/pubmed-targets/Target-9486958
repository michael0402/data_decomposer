The protease inhibitors, ritonavir, indinavir and saquinavir, the most potent anti-HIV drugs developed to date, interact with many drugs by competing for CYP3A4, an enzyme central to the metabolism of a wide variety of compounds. Human liver microsomes were used to compare inhibition by these three protease inhibitors. The inhibition was the greatest with ritonavir and indinavir and less potent with saquinavir.
