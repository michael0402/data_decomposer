BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that estrogen signaling may be involved in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Aromatase is an enzyme complex that catalyses the final step in estrogen synthesis and is present in several tissues, including the lung. In the current study we investigated the activity of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane in human NSCLC cell lines H23 and A549.
RESULTS: Aromatase expression was detected in both cell lines. H23 cells showed lower protein and mRNA levels of aromatase, compared to A549 cells. Exemestane decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in both cell lines, 48 h after its application, with A549 exhibiting higher sensitivity than H23 cells. Aromatase protein and mRNA levels were not affected by exemestane in A549 cells, whereas an increase in both protein and mRNA levels was observed in H23 cells, 48 h after exemestane application. Moreover, an increase in cAMP levels was found in both cell lines, 15 min after the administration of exemestane. In addition, we studied the effect of exemestane on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) localization and activation. Exemestane increased EGFR activation 15 min after its application in H23 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated a translocation of EGFR from cell membrane, 24 h after the addition of exemestane in H23 cells. No changes in EGFR activation or localization were observed in A549 cells.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest an antiproliferative effect of exemestane on NSCLC cell lines. Exemestane may be more effective in cells with higher aromatase levels. Further studies are needed to assess the activity of exemestane in NSCLC.
