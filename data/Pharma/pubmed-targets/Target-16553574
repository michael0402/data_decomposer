Alpha1-receptor blockers have become first-line therapy for the medical management of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, adverse effects such as cardiovascular intolerance can limit their use. This article focuses on alfuzosin, a clinically uroselective, alpha1-adrenergic antagonist that is available as a novel once-daily formulation that does not require dose titration. Alfuzosin is less vasoactive than other non-subtype selective alpha1-receptor blockers. In addition to effects on lower urinary tract symptoms, it is also used as an adjunct to urethral catheterisation in patients with acute urinary retention related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, and can improve sexual function and health-related quality of life in benign prostatic hyperplasia sufferers.
