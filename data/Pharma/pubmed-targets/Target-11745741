The present study characterized the response of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) to chronic ritonavir (RIT) exposure by assessing increases in P-gp and MRP1 protein expression and activity. LS-180V intestinal carcinoma cells were exposed for 3 days to 1-100 microM RIT concurrently with controls. P-gp and MRP1 protein was quantified by Western blot analysis. Cell accumulation assays, using the P-gp substrate rhodamine 123 (RH123), the P-gp/MRP1 substrate doxorubicin (DOX), and the MRP substrate carboxyfluorescein (CBF), were performed as a measure of transporter activity. RIT strongly induced P-gp and MRP1 expression (maximum 6-fold and 3-fold increases, respectively) in a concentration-dependent fashion. Following extended exposure to RIT (> 10 microM), cells accumulated < 50% of the RH123 and DOX compared with controls, whereas accumulation of CBF was decreased by 30% at 30 microM. Differences in cell accumulation of RH123 could be eliminated with verapamil (100 microM; a P-gp inhibitor), whereas decreased DOX cell accumulation was only partially reversed by verapamil. Indomethacin (100 microM; an MRP1 inhibitor) had no significant effect on RH123 or DOX accumulation, suggesting limited MRP1-mediated activity. Thus, RIT induced protein expression of P-gp and MRP1 and increased cellular drug exclusion of RH123, DOX, and CBF. Similar in vivo phenomena may occur during anti-HIV drug therapy, explaining potential decrements in therapeutic efficacy due to decreases in bioavailability or alterations in drug distribution.
