A role of the potent and long-acting vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 and the pathophysiology of chronic human heart failure has been postulated based upon indirect evidence such as elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels and their with the degree of hemodynamic impairment. The advent of specific of endothelin-1 receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity not only to directly evaluate its pathophysiological role but also to assess its potential role as a new approach to heart failure therapy. This brief review summarizes the evidence linking endothelin-1 to the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure and the clinical results obtained in patients during acute, intravenous and more prolonged, oral administration with bosentan, a mixed ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist. Bosentan acutely and during short-term oral therapy markedly improved hemodynamics in patients in addition to standard heart failure therapy, including an ACE-inhibitor. These effects were associated with a reduced responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin system to diuretic therapy and reduced basal plasma aldosterone levels. Although the hemodynamic and neurohumoral profile of short-term bosentan therapy looks promising for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure appropriate trials will have to be performed to document clinical benefit during long-term therapy. Finally, the question remains open whether mixed endothelin-1 receptor antagonists like bosentan will have similar effects as compared to antagonists which block the ET(A) receptor only.
