Dihydroergotamine produces external carotid vasoconstriction in vagosympathectomized dogs by 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. This study identified the specific subtypes involved in this response. One-minute intracarotid infusions of dihydroergotamine (5.6-10 microg/min) dose-dependently decreased external carotid blood flow without affecting blood pressure or heart rate. This response was: (1) partly blocked in dogs pretreated intravenously with the antagonists SB224289 (5-HT(1B); 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1'-methyl-5-[2'-methyl-4' (5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-carbonyl]furo[2,3-f]indole-3-spiro-4'-piperidine hydrochloride), rauwolscine (alpha(2)), BRL44408 (alpha(2A); 2-[2H-(1-methyl-1,3-dihydroisoindole)methyl]-4,5-dihydroimidazole) or MK912 (alpha(2C); (2S,12bS)-1'3'-dimethylspiro(1,3,4,5',6,6',7,12b-octahydro-2Hbenzo[b]furo[2,3-a]quinazoline)-2,4'-pyrimidin-2'-one); (2) markedly blocked after SB224289 plus rauwolscine; and (3) unaffected after BRL15572 (5-HT(1D); 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-[3,3-diphenyl (2-(S,R) hydroxypropanyl) piperazine] hydrochloride) or imiloxan (alpha(2B)). Therefore, the above response involves 5-HT(1B) receptors and alpha(2A/2C)-adrenoceptors.
