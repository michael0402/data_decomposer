Reduced levonorgestrel concentrations from the levonorgestrel contraceptive implant was previously seen when given concomitantly with efavirenz. We sought to assess whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in efavirenz and nevirapine metabolism were linked to these changes in levonorgestrel concentration. SNPs in CYP2B6, CYP2A6, NR1I2, and NR1I3 were analyzed. Associations of participant demographics and genotype with levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics were evaluated in HIV-positive women using the levonorgestrel implant plus efavirenz- or nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART), in comparison to ART-naÃ¯ve women using multivariate linear regression. Efavirenz group: CYP2B6 516G>T was associated with lower levonorgestrel log
