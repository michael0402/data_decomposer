The purpose of this study was to elucidate the involvement of Mate1 in the tubular secretion of trimethoprim and saturation of Mate1-mediated efflux to address the mechanisms underlying the pharmacokinetic drug interactions with trimethoprim. Trimethoprim is a more potent inhibitor of MATE2-K than MATE1 with K
