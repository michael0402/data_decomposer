AIMS: Anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor widely used in breast cancer, has recently been indicated to be a P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) substrate. We have aimed to determine whether ABCB1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect anastrozole plasma concentrations in these patients. In addition, we assessed the impact of SNPs in CYP19A1 and TCL1A on the development of arthralgia and cancer recurrence in our series.
METHODS: This study included 110 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Anastrozole plasma levels were determined by a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry system. Patients were genotyped for SNPs in the ABCB1, TCL1A and CYP19A1 genes to search for associations with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters using logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Anastrozole concentrations showed an almost nine-fold interindividual variability (mean 26.95 ± 11.91 ng ml
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that variability in anastrozole plasma levels may be attributable to the status of the ABCB1 gene locus. Furthermore, genetic variants in CYP19A1 were associated with arthralgia and cancer recurrence in our patients.
