PURPOSE: The clinical issues surrounding the use of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence are reviewed.
SUMMARY: Opioids continue to be some of the most frequently reported prescription medications in substance abuse- related cases. A semisynthetic derivative of thebaine, buprenorphine hydrochloride is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and kappa-receptor antagonist with a long duration of action. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of buprenorphine are not well characterized. The ethical and legal issues associated with the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence are complex. Clinical trials have compared the efficacy of methadone, buprenorphine, and buprenorphine-naloxone for the detoxification and maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. Based on the available literature, it appears that buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone, and methadone are similarly efficacious for the treatment of opioid-dependent patients. Buprenorphine-naloxone has less potential for abuse and diversion. The adverse-effect profiles for buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone, and methadone are similar. Once-weekly office visits for patient evaluation and dispensing of buprenorphine seem feasible and convenient for both practitioners and patients. The three phases of opioid maintenance treatment are induction, stabilization, and maintenance. It is good practice for the admitting physician to consult with the patient's addiction treatment provider, when possible, to obtain the patient's treatment history.
CONCLUSION: Buprenorphine is an attractive option for the pharmacologic treatment of opioid dependence. Compliance and adherence to buprenorphine therapy for opioid-dependent patients remain clinical issues. Future research efforts should focus on improving compliance and adherence to buprenorphine therapy.
