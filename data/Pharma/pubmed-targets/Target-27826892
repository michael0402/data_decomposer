Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is one of the safest and most commonly used anaesthetic agents for intravenous general anaesthesia. However, in clinical practice, a large inter-individual variability in response to propofol is observed. To limit the risk of adverse effects, pharmacogenetic investigations are recommended. The aim of our study was to verify the impact of genetic changes c.516G>T in the CYP2B6, c.98T>C in the UGT1A9 and c.1075A>C in the CYP2C9 genes on the individual propofol pharmacokinetic profile in the Polish patients undergoing general anaesthesia. Eighty-five patients from the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, Regional Hospital in Poznan, Poland, anaesthetised with propofol for surgery, were enrolled in the study. We have genotyped CYP2B6, UGT1A9 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms with the use of pyrosequencing. HPLC measurements of propofol plasma concentration were applied for a pharmacokinetic analysis of the anaesthetic. We identified poor (20), intermediate (42) and rapid (23) metabolisers of propofol, which constituted 24%, 49% and 27% of the group, respectively. Homozygotes c.516 T/T in the CYP2B6 gene were statistically more often found in the rapid metabolisers group (p < 0.05). However, polymorphisms c.98T>C in the UGT1A9 and c.1075A>C in the CYP2C9 genes did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of propofol. The mean propofol retention time (MRT) correlated with the patient's body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.05). From all the analysed changes, only polymorphism c.516G>T in the CYP2B6 gene and BMI affect the metabolism rate of propofol and may play an important role in the optimisation of propofol anaesthesia.
