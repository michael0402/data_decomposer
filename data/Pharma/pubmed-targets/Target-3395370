The binding of indapamide to isolated serum proteins and erythrocytes was studied in order to understand its blood distribution. In serum, indapamide was mainly bound to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein with a high affinity (K = 73.4/mM), and to albumin and lipoproteins. Indapamide was bound to erythrocytes via a saturable process with a high affinity (K = 385/mM and N = 57 microM for an hematocrit value of 0.48), and erythrocytes were the main binding component in blood (more than 80% of indapamide was associated to erythrocytes in blood). The binding to serum proteins affected indapamide distribution in blood, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was shown to be the more effective protein in decreasing the amount of indapamide associated to erythrocytes.
