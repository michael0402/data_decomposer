In this review the clinical pharmacology of HIV protease inhibitors, a new class of antiretroviral drugs, is discussed. After considering HIV protease function and structure, the development of inhibitors of HIV protease is presented. Three protease inhibitors are reviewed in more detail: saquinavir, indinavir, and ritonavir. Clinical trial results with these agents are evaluated. Furthermore, adverse effects, resistance, dosage and administration, clinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships, and drug interactions are discussed.
