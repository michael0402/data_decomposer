1. In vitro metabolic studies with etodolac were performed. S- and R-etodolac were converted to the acylglucuronide and hydroxylated metabolites by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and cytochrome P450 in microsomes. However, the stereoselectivities of UGT and P450 for the isomers were opposite. S-etodolac was glucuronidated preferentially than R-etodolac by UGT. In contrast, R-etodolac was hydroxylated preferentially than S-etodolac by P450. 2. Of several human P450 enzymes, CYP2C9 had the greatest activity for hydroxylation of R-etodolac. Sulfaphenazole, an inhibitor of CYP2C9, and anti-CYP2C9 antibody inhibited the hydroxylation of R-etodolac in human liver microsomes. CYP2C9 therefore contributes to the stereoselective hydroxylation of R-etodolac. 3. Of several human UGT enzymes, UGT1A9 had the greatest activity for glucuronidation of S-etodolac. Propofol and thyroxine, inhibitors of UGT1A9, inhibited the glucuronidation of S-etodolac in human liver microsomes. Therefore, UGT1A9 is mainly responsible for the stereoselective glucuronidation of S-etodolac. 4. Because S-etodolac was metabolized more rapidly than R-etodolac in human cryopreserved hepatocytes, the stereoselectivities of UGT1A9 for etodolac substantially influenced the overall metabolism of S- and R-etodolac in man.
