Modulators of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can enhance or limit the permeability of a number of therapeutic agents that are considered substrates of this efflux pump protein. The modulatory effect of amlodipine (4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist) on P-gp efflux activity has not been fully elucidated. We have studied the concentration dependency of its modulatory effect and compared it qualitatively with tamoxifen (a non-esteroid anti-estrogen). The investigation was conducted on transmembrane efflux of doxorubicin at a fixed concentration of 5 microM across a Caco-2 monolayer in the presence of various concentrations of amlodipine or tamoxifen. The maximum flux of doxorubicin from basolateral to apical (ba) occurred at 4.5 microM amlodipine and at 0.02 microM tamoxifen. At higher concentrations, the apical to basolateral (ab) flux and the net flux of doxorubicin (ba - ab) declined steadily in a concentration-dependent manner. We analysed the observed net flux data by fitting different mathematical models to the data. A composite sigmoidal Emax/Imax (stimulatory/inhibitory) model was found to be the most appropriate to define the system. The observed and calculated parameters supported the modulatory role of both compounds and clearly indicated that the stimulation and inhibition of transmembrane efflux occurred simultaneously in the presence of amlodipine or tamoxifen. It was concluded that amlodipine, similar to tamoxifen, modulated the transporter-dependent transmembrane flux of the P-gp substrate in a concentration-dependent manner.
