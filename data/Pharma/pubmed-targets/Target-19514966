Gemcitabine is a cytotoxic nucleoside analog, which is widely used in the treatment of malignancies. Interindividual differences in gemcitabine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been demonstrated. Pharmacogenetic factors may account for a significant proportion of these differences. This review provides an update on the pharmacogenetics of gemcitabine and its influence on gemcitabine efficacy and toxicity.
