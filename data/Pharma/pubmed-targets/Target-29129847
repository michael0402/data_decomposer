Cyclophosphamide (CP) is widely used in anticancer therapy regimens and 2-dechloroethylcyclophosphamide (DECP) is its side-chain dechloroethylated metabolite. N-dechloroethylation of CP mediated by the enzyme CYP3A4 yields nephrotoxic and neurotoxic chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) in equimolar amount to DECP. This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of ketoconazole (KTZ) on CP metabolism through in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) research. Long-term treatment of KTZ induces hepatic injury; thus single doses of KTZ at low, middle, and high levels (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) were investigated for pharmacokinetic DDI with CP. Our in vitro human liver microsome modeling approach suggested that KTZ inhibited CYP3A4 activity and then decreased DECP exposure. In addition, an UHPLC-MS/MS method for quantifying CP, DECP, and KTZ in rat plasma was developed and fully validated with a 4 min analysis coupled with a simple and reproducible one-step protein precipitation. A further in vivo pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that combination use of CP (10 mg/kg) and KTZ (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) in rats caused a KTZ dose-dependent decrease in main parameters of DECP (C
