To characterize intraadrenal adaptations for inhibition of cortisol synthesis, we analyzed the effects of etomidate (ETO) on steroid hormone secretion and expression of key regulators of steroidogenesis and proliferation in human NCI-h295 adrenocortical cancer cells. Etomidate potently blocked 11beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), and side chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1). This inhibition of steroidogenesis was associated with increased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), and CYP11A1 and 17alpha-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase (CYP17A1) protein levels, but not of the respective mRNA levels. Promoter activity of CYP11A1 and melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) was not increased by etomidate in treated cells compared to controls. The increase in protein levels was partially reversed by cycloheximide suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms but also protein stabilization as underlying cause. Furthermore, ETO exhibited antiproliferative activity paralleled by a decrease in phosphorylation of MEK and ERK1, 2. In summary, ETO exhibits pleiotropic effects on adrenal function in vitro. Inhibition of steroidogenesis is followed by increased levels of steroidogenic key proteins and reduced proliferation. These changes reflect adaptations to maintain steroidogenesis at the cost of adrenal proliferation.
