EKB-569 is a potent, low molecular weight, selective, and irreversible inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is being developed as an anticancer agent. A phase 1, dose-escalation study was conducted in Japanese patients. EKB-569 was administered orally, once daily, in 28-day cycles, to patients with advanced-stage malignancies known to overexpress EGFR. Two patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations and acquired gefitinib resistance from the phase 1 study are described in detail. Case #1 is a 63-year-old man with smoking history. He received treatment from 4 March 2004. Because he had no severe adverse events, a total of 10 courses of therapy were completed through December 16. Grade 2 skin rash and ALT elevation, and grade 1 diarrhea and nail changes developed. A chest CT scan on 4 August 2003 revealed multiple pulmonary metastases that had decreased in size. Case #2 is a 49-year-old woman with no smoking history. She received therapy from 9 February 2004. She received a total of five courses of the therapy until 22 June 2004. Grade 3 nausea and vomiting and grade 1 diarrhea and dry skin developed. A chest CT scan on March 3 revealed multiple pulmonary metastases that had decreased in size. A brain MRI on March 4 showed that multiple brain metastases also had decreased in size. Based on RECIST criteria, they had stable disease but radiographic tumor regression was observed.
