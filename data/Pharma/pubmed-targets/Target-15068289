The binding of gatifloxacin to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in aqueous solution was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy and absorbance spectra, Further, the interactions influenced by Fe3+ and Cu2+ were also explored in this work. Based on Scatchard's site-binding model and florescence quenching, practical formulas for small molecule ligands to bio-macromolecules have been proposed. The binding parameters were measured according to suggested models, and the binding distance and the transfer efficiency of energy between gatifloxacin and BSA were also obtained in view of the FÃ¶rster theory of non-radiation energy transfer. The effect of gatifloxacin on the conformation of BSA has also been analyzed using synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy.
