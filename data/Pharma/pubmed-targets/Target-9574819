1. Ivermectin was extensively metabolized by human liver microsomes to at least 10 metabolites. The structure of many of them (mostly hydroxylated and demethylated) was determined by 1H-NMR and LC/MS. 2. To determine which human cytochrome P450 isoform(s) is responsible for the metabolism of ivermectin, chemical inhibitors including sulphaphenazole, quinidine, furafylline, troleandomycin (TAO) and diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) were used to evaluate their effect on ivermectin metabolism. TAO, a specific inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A4, was the most potent inhibitor, inhibiting the total metabolism as well as formation of each metabolite. Metabolism was also inhibited by an anti-human cytochrome 3A4 antibody by 90%. 3. When ivermectin was incubated with microsomes from cells expressing CYP1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4 at 4 mg/ml protein concentrations, metabolic activity was only detected with the microsomes containing CYP3A4. The metabolic profile from cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 microsomes was qualitatively similar to that from human liver microsomes. 4. Thus, cytochrome P4503A4 is the predominant isoform responsible for the metabolism of ivermectin by human liver microsomes.
