5-Fluorouracil (FU) is an important and widely used antineoplastic drug that is carried in the serum by plasma proteins. Protein binding studies of this drug to human serum albumin (HSA) have been carried out by several spectroscopic techniques. Difference circular dichroism and UV studies provided information on the class of binding sites involved in the interaction. In particular, displacement experiments showed that FU has at least one secondary binding site in the coumarin binding area, but does not interact with the benzodiazepine binding area. Binding was also investigated by difference 1H NMR and by measuring the increase in the 19F NMR signal of FU when bound to HSA. Finally, evidence was obtained that chemical acetylation of Lys199 results in a decreased apparent binding affinity constant (nK) for FU. Such a modification is induced under physiological conditions by aspirin.
