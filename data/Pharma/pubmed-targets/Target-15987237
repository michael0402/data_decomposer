Ipratropium bromide is a nonselective antagonist of the muscarinic receptors located on airway smooth muscle, and is delivered via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI). Because of the requirement to phase out chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-propelled MDIs, the ipratropium bromide inhalation aerosol MDI has been redesigned with a hydrofluoroalkane as the propellant (ipratropium bromide HFA). Ipratropium bromide HFA has recently been approved in the US for the maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD. Ipratropium bromide HFA 42 microg four times daily (one dose [42 microg] is delivered via two puffs of the inhaler) demonstrated comparable efficacy to that of ipratropium bromide CFC 42 microg four times daily, as measured by spirometric testing, in a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial in patients with stable COPD. Similarly, four-times-daily ipratropium bromide HFA 42 microg and ipratropium bromide CFC 42 microg provided a comparable degree of bronchodilation in patients with stable COPD during a 1-year, open-label study primarily designed to assess safety. In both studies, the tolerability profiles of ipratropium bromide HFA and ipratropium bromide CFC were comparable. The most common adverse events were related to respiratory system disorders. During the 1-year study, dry mouth was reported by 1.3% and 0.7% of patients in the ipratropium bromide HFA or ipratropium bromide CFC groups.
