The effects of two new phthalazinone derivatives, azelastine (AZ) and flezelastine (FZ), on the reversal of resistance to doxorubicin (dox) were studied using two variants of the rat C6 glioblastoma cell line, selected with dox (C6 0.5) or with vincristine (C6 1V). Both lines presented a multidrug-resistant phenotype which was, in the case of C6 0.5 cells, likely to be accompanied by an additional mechanism leading to intracellular tolerance of the drug. Both AZ and FZ reversed dox resistance in a concentration-dependent manner, and FZ was shown to be at least three times more potent than AZ. FZ was able, at a relatively high concentration (30 microM), to completely restore dox sensitivity in both cell lines. Both drugs were able to virtually restore dox accumulation to the level reached in sensitive cells, and, interestingly, this complete restoration occurred at lower concentrations of modulator than required for complete reversal of resistance. FZ was able to reverse dox intracellular tolerance of C6 0.5 cells and to restore dox accumulation at the IC50 to the level observed in sensitive cells. AZ and FZ both inhibited azidopine binding to membrane preparations of C6 0.5 and C6 1V cells, although FZ was more potent. Both drugs more successfully inhibited azidopine binding to membranes prepared from C6 1V cells (which express the mdr1b gene product) than to membranes from C6 0.5 cells (which express the mdr1a gene product). In view of its potent activity on MDR, further preclinical evaluation of FZ is warranted.
