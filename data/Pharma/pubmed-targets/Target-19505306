Two HIV-1 infected patients developed signs and symptoms consistent with adrenal suppression after being exposed to intra-articular triamcinolone acetate while also receiving ritonavir as part of their highly active antiretroviral therapy. Laboratory evaluation confirmed secondary adrenal suppression in both cases. Both patients recovered without the need for chronic replacement steroids. Adrenal suppression has been described as an adverse outcome in patients treated with fluticasone and concomitant ritonavir. In the reported cases, the adrenal suppression likely developed as a result of increased systemic concentrations of triamcinolone due to an inhibition of cytochrome p450 3A4 metabolism. Practitioners of HIV medicine should be aware of the potential negative interaction of injected triamcinolone and ritonavir.
