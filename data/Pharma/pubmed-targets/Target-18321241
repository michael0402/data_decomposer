BACKGROUND: Alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid) is a unique panagonist retinoid, capable of binding to all six known retinoid receptors (RAR-alpha, -beta, -gamma, and RXR-alpha, -beta, -gamma). Studies are being carried out to determine how best to utilize this characteristic in treatments for conditions such as chronic hand dermatitis.
OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on alitretinoin.
METHODS: The scope of the review encompasses ways that alitretinoin is currently and may potentially be utilized.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered alitretinoin is a safe and effective treatment for chronic hand dermatitis. Topical treatment with alitretinoin can be expanded into other areas such as photoaged skin and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Despite these benefits, oral alitretinoin will face a difficult path attaining approval for use in the US.
