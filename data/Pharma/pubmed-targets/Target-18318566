Dutasteride (Avodart), an oral synthetic 4-azasteroid, is a potent, selective, irreversible inhibitor of type 1 and type 2 5alpha-reductase (5AR), the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) intracellularly. Although type 2 5AR predominates, both isoenzymes are overexpressed in prostate tissue in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and at all stages in some prostate cancers. Oral dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic BPH in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, and to reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and the need for BPH-related surgery.In pivotal 2-year phase III trials, oral dutasteride 0.5 mg once daily improved urinary symptoms, decreased total prostate volume (TPV), and reduced the risk of AUR and BPH-related surgery in men with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH and prostate enlargement. The good efficacy and tolerability of dutasteride was maintained for up to 4 years in open-label extension studies. Results of the pre-planned, 2-year interim analysis of the CombAT trial showed that the combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin was superior to either drug as monotherapy in improving BPH-related symptoms, peak urinary flow and BPH-related health status. The overall adverse event profile for combination therapy was consistent with those reported for both monotherapies. Although drug-related adverse events were more frequent with combination therapy versus both monotherapies, most did not result in treatment cessation. Dutasteride is being investigated for its efficacy in reducing the risk of prostate cancer in at-risk men in the 4-year REDUCE study and as treatment to extend the time to progression in men with low-risk localized prostate cancer who would otherwise undergo watchful waiting in the 3-year REDEEM study. Thus, dutasteride is an effective treatment option in patients with moderate to severe symptomatic BPH and demonstrable prostatic enlargement, and may have potential to reduce the risk of developing biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in at-risk individuals or extending the time to progression in low-risk localized prostate cancer.
