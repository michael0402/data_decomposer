Ropinirole prolonged release is a once-daily, 24-hour formulation of ropinirole, a non-ergot dopamine agonist. It is approved as monotherapy and as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Several potential advantages of ropinirole prolonged release compared to the immediate release formulation include maintaining more consistent dopaminergic activity with steadier plasma levels, increased tolerability, greater compliance from a simpler once-daily dosing regimen and ease in dose titration. In a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority, crossover study, ropinirole prolonged release was shown to have comparable efficacy and tolerability to immediate release ropinirole in early PD patients, with significantly greater compliance. Subjects were converted overnight between ropinirole formulations without loss of efficacy and with good tolerability. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in advanced PD, daily "off" time was reduced by an average of 2.1 hours with ropinirole prolonged release compared to 0.4 hours with placebo. Patients on ropinirole prolonged release were also more likely to require less daily levodopa. Ropinirole prolonged release is well tolerated with a similar adverse effect profile to other non-ergot dopamine agonists. The most common adverse effects include dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, somnolence, abdominal pain or discomfort and orthostatic hypotension. Ropinirole prolonged release is a safe and effective treatment option for both early and advanced PD. This manuscript briefly reviews the current pharmacological treatment options for PD and provides a more detailed review of the currently available data regarding ropinirole prolonged release as a treatment option for PD.
