The development of essential hypertension (EH) and inter-individual differences in response to antihypertensive treatment may partly result from genetic heterogeneity. In this study, we conducted an investigation of the combined effects of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and methionine synthase (MS) A2756G polymorphisms on baseline blood pressure (BP) and BP response to antihypertensive Benazepril treatment in 823 Chinese hypertensive patients with a fixed daily dosage of 10 mg for 15 consecutive days. When MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G polymorphisms were modelled together with adjustment for important covariates, only MTHFR C677T was associated with baseline systolic BP (SBP) (β (s.e.)=2.84 (1.10), P=0.0096) or baseline diastolic BP (DBP) (β (s.e.)=2.19 (0.65), P=0.0008). Modelled together with adjustment for important covariates, MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G polymorphisms were both independently associated with increased DBP response (baseline minus post-treatment) to Benazepril treatment (C677T: β (s.e.)=1.58 (0.76), P=0.038; A2756G: β (s.e.)=2.14 (0.89), P=0.016). Neither polymorphism was associated with SBP response to Benazepril treatment. There were no significant interactions or effect modification between MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G gene polymorphisms in models of baseline SBP, baseline DBP or DBP response to Benazepril treatment. Our results suggest that the effects of MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G gene polymorphisms may have pivotal roles in the aetiology of EH and BP response to Benazepril treatment.
