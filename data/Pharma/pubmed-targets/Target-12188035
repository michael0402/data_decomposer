Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most effective drugs for anti-inflammatory diseases. A number of adverse side effects, however, limit chronic treatment with GCs. To improve their therapeutic usefulness, attempts have been made to dissociate the two main actions of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), transactivation and transrepression, which are believed to be responsible for the side effects and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. We report here species-specific differences in the transactivation response mediated by GR. Dexamethasone (DEX), betamethasone (BM), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression agonistic activity in a reporter assay using CV-1 cells transfected with either human or rat GR. These GCs also had full transactivation agonistic activity in CV-1 cells transfected with human GR. The esterified-BM, however, had only partial transactivation agonistic activity in cells transfected with rat GR, whereas BM and esterified-DEX had full transactivation agonistic activity. Moreover, in rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells, the esterified-BM failed to induce tyrosine aminotransferase, which is regulated by GR-mediated transactivation activity. There were no significant differences between the binding affinity of these GCs to human and rat GR. Consistent with the weak transactivation activity of esterified-BM mediated by rat GR, there were few side effects, evaluated by thymus involution and body weight loss, in an antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats. These results suggest that the potency of esterified-BM to induce transactivation activity is different between species and that this difference is not due to differences in receptor binding.
