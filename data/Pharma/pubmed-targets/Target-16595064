BACKGROUND: Docetaxel and topotecan are drugs with different mechanisms of action and significant activity against various tumour types. Topotecan may influence docetaxel metabolism by inhibiting the CYP3A4 enzyme. We designed a phase I study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of this combination and to assess the impact of pharmacokinetic interactions of the two drugs on toxicity.
METHODS: Docetaxel and topotecan were administered intravenously on day 1, and days 1 - 5 respectively, using a phase I dose escalation design. Plasma samples were analysed to determine docetaxel and topotecan concentration by HPLC with subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis using NONMEM.
RESULTS: Of the 17 patients enrolled in the trial, 11 had grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and 1 had grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Nonhaematological toxicities were less frequent. The maximum tolerated dose for docetaxel and topotecan were 60 mg/m(2) on day 1 and 0.75 mg/m(2) days 1 - 5, respectively. One patient had stable disease. Subjects with grade >or= 3 haematologic toxicity had higher plasma docetaxel or topotecan area under the curve (AUC) (docetaxel 1.03 +/- 0.11 mg-hr/L versus 0.73 +/- 0.13 mg-hr/L; topotecan 65.8 +/- 14.6 mcg-hr/L versus 41.6 +/- 13.9 mcg-hr/L). There was no additive effect of the AUC of the two drugs on the likelihood of grade >or= 3 haematologic toxicity by multiple logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: The dose-limiting toxicity seen with the combination of docetaxel and topotecan was myelosuppression. Future trials will require growth factor support if this combination is pursued.
