The advanced macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin, and the ketolide, telithromycin, are structural analogs of erythromycin. They have several distinct advantages when compared with erythromycin, including enhanced spectrum of activity, more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, once-daily administration, and improved tolerability. Clarithromycin and azithromycin are used extensively for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases, and Helicobacter pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease. Telithromycin is approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Severe hepatotoxicity has been reported with the use of telithromycin.
