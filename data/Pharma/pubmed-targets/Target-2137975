The pharmacologic profiles of danazol and nafarelin differ considerably from each other. Danazol interacts with multiple classes of proteins, whereas the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist nafarelin interacts only with the pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Differences in the molecular, endocrine, and clinical pharmacologic properties of these agents may provide clues to their varying effects in the management of women with endometriosis.
