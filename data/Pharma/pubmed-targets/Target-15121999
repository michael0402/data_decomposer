OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, virology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) emtricitabine.
DATA SOURCES: English-language reports were accessed using MEDLINE (1966-June 2003) and the Iowa Drug Information Service database (1966-June 2003) using emtricitabine and Coviracil as key words. (Coviracil was the proposed trade name for the product prior to approval.) The Internet was also searched using the terms HIV/AIDS conferences, then emtricitabine within the conference proceedings.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Abstracts, posters, and oral presentations from scientific conferences, both published and unpublished, were included. Preference was given to published controlled trials. Studies providing a description of the pharmacology, virology, effectiveness, safety, or pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine were used in this review.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Emtricitabine is an NRTI used to treat HIV-1 infection. Once-daily administration can decrease pill burden and potentially increase adherence to multidrug HIV therapy. Further, emtricitabine has shown equivalent or improved outcomes compared with lamivudine and stavudine.
CONCLUSIONS: Emtricitabine is a safe and effective option for HIV-1 infection in adults as part of a multidrug regimen. It may be a better alternative than lamivudine for once-daily therapy because of its extended intracellular half-life and better than lamivudine and stavudine because of a possibly decreased potential for drug resistance.
