The method of lovastatine and mevinolinic acid known as competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA-reductase and produced by micromycetes was elaborated. The inhibitors from diluted water solutions were fully absorbed on Diapak C16 patrons. The rate of inhibitors elution from the patrones was more than 95 per cent. Patrons may be used for concentration of lovastatine group inhibitors from the culture media. Inhibitors synthesis by the Penicillium citrinum 89 was investigated in dynamics with the use of Diapak C16 patrones. It was shown that UV-spectrum of inhibitor produced by P. citrinum 89 was identical with compactin spectrum and had absorbance maximum at 230, 237 and 247 nm.
