The aim of the present study was to identify cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes involved in the 5-sulfoxidation, mono-N-demethylation and di-N-demethylation of the aliphatic-type phenothiazine neuroleptic chlorpromazine in human liver. Experiments were performed in vitro using cDNA-expressed human CYP isoforms (Supersomes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4), liver microsomes from different donors and CYP-selective inhibitors. The obtained results indicate that CYP1A2 is the only CYP isoform that catalyzes the mono-N-demethylation and di-N-demethylation of chlorpromazine (100%) and is the main isoform responsible for chlorpromazine 5-sulfoxidation (64%) at a therapeutic concentration of the drug (10 microM). CYP3A4 contributes to a lesser degree to chlorpromazine 5-sulfoxidation (34%). The role of CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 in catalyzing of the latter reaction is negligible (0.1-2%). Similar results were obtained at a higher, non-therapeutic concentration of the drug (100 microM); however, the contribution of CYP1A2 to chlorpromazine mono-N-demethylation was noticeably lower (75%), mostly in favour of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 (about 12% each). The obtained results indicate that the catalysis of chlorpromazine N-demethylation and 5-sulfoxidation in humans exhibits a stricter CYP1A2 preference compared to the previously tested phenothiazines (promazine, perazine, and thioridazine). Hence pharmacokinetic interactions involving chlorpromazine and CYP1A2 substrates and inhibitors are likely to occur. Considering strong dopaminergic D(2), noradrenergic alpha(1) and cholinergic M(1) receptor blocking properties of chlorpromazine and some of its metabolites, as well as their serious side effects, the obtained results may be of pharmacological and clinical importance.
