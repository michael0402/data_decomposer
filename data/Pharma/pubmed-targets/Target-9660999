AZT (zidovudine, 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), although metabolized primarily to AZT-glucuronide, is also metabolized to 3'-amino-3'-deoxythmidine (AMT) by reduction of the azide to an amine. The formation of the myelotoxic metabolite AMT has not been well characterized, but inhibition of AMT formation would be of therapeutic benefit. The aim of this study was to identify compounds that inhibit AMT formation. Using human liver microsomes under anaerobic conditions and [2-14C]AZT, K(m) values of AZT azido-reductase, estimated by radio-thin-layer chromatography, were 2.2 to 3.5 mM (n = 3). Oxygen completely inhibited this NADPH-dependent reduction. Thirteen of the 28 compounds tested inhibited the formation of AMT. In addition to the CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, fluconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir, metyrapone strongly inhibited AMT formation. An unexpected finding was the more-than-twofold increase in AMT formation in the presence of ethacrynic acid, dipyridamole, or indomethacin. Such activation of toxic metabolite formation would impair drug therapy.
