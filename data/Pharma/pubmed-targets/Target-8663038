A fluorescent vinblastine derivative, vinblastine-4'-anthranilate, has been shown to inhibit polymerization of rat brain tubulin (IC50 = 4.8 microM). Binding of the drug to tubulin increases fluorescence intensity, causes a small emission blue shift, and has a quantum yield of 0.037. Fluorescence increases as a function of drug concentration, with a high affinity site and an undetermined number of lower affinity sites. Photolabeling, by exciting the fluorescent drug-tubulin complex at the absorption maximum of anthranilate, yields a covalent adduct confined to beta-tubulin. Its formation is specific in that it is blocked by maytansine or vinblastine. Tryptic hydrolysis identifies a single fluorescent beta-peptide coinciding with residues 175-213. The interactions between various ligands at this central portion of beta-tubulin are discussed.
