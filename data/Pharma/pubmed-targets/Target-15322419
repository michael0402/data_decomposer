OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the association between alleles of the norepinephrine transporter gene and the methylphenidate response.
METHOD: Chinese Han youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder recruited in the Outpatient Department of the Institute of Mental Health from 2001 to 2004 were treated with methylphenidate in doses of 0.45 to 0.60 mg/kg per day. Behavior changes were measured by the ADHD Rating Scale-IV when optimal doses were reached. The single-nucleotide polymorphic allele of norepinephrine transporter gene G1287A was used as the genetic marker, and the genotypes were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
RESULTS: A significant association was found between norepinephrine transporter gene G1287A genotypes and response to methylphenidate for hyperactive-impulsive subscale scores (mean score reduction was 7.15 and 6.94 for G/G and G/A genotype, respectively, and 2.13 for A/A; p = .012) but not inattentive scores.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an association between the G1287A polymorphism of the norepinephrine transporter gene and variation in methylphenidate response. Further work is needed to confirm this finding and to assess its generalization to other ethnic groups.
