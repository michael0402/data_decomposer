Successful management of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires a multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach that involves patient education and support, lifestyle modification, and appropriate use of pharmacologic interventions with frequent monitoring and adjustment to ensure that target goals for hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension are achieved and maintained. Studies have shown that the bile acid sequestrant colesevelam HCl reduces hemoglobin A1c and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in patients with prediabetes and T2DM. This article briefly reviews current treatment guidelines for patients with prediabetes and T2DM and the potential role of colesevelam in the management of prediabetes and T2DM with oral antidiabetes agents.
