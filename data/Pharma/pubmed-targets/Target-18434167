In this work we prepared and characterized an inclusion complex of the dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor sulfadiazine (SDZ) in 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD). From the phase-solubility diagram we observed an increase in the water solubility of the drug, calculating a binding constant of 1879M(-1). The inclusion mode involves a NH(2)-in orientation of the drug in the HPBCD cavity, according to the 2D NMR (ROESY) data and confirmed by molecular modeling using the semiempirical PM6 and RM1 methods.
