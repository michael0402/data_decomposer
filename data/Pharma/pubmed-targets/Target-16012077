To predict drug interactions with estazolam, the biotransformation of estazolam to its major hydoxylated metabolite, 4-hydroxyestazolam was studied in vitro using pooled human liver microsomes and individual expressed human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Estazolam was metabolized to 4-hydroxyestazolam according to the Hill kinetic model in pooled human liver microsomes. The Km value for the 4-hydroxylation of estazolam was 24.1 microM, and the Vmax value was 52.6 pmol min(-1)mg(-1) protein. The formation of 4-hydroxyestazolam from estazolam in pooled human liver microsomes was significantly inhibited by itraconazole and erythromycin, specific CYP3A4 inhibitors, in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 1.1 and 12.8 microM, respectively. When estazolam was incubated with expressed human CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4), it was metabolized only by CYP3A4. In conclusion, the biotransformation of estazolam to 4-hydroxyestazolam was catalyzed by CYP3A4.
