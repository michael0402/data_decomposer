Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of patients with hypertension. Although irbesartan does not require biotransformation for its pharmacological activity, it does undergo metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 isoenzyme and negligible metabolism by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. The long term treatment of patients with hypertension is generally required for effective management of the disease, and the use of concurrent medications is usually inevitable. This paper reviews the drug and food interaction trials involving irbesartan that have been conducted to date. Based on the available literature, no significant interactions have been identified between irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, simvastatin, tolbutamide, warfarin, magnesium and aluminum hydroxides, digoxin or food. Fluconazole did increase the steady-state peak plasma concentration (by 19%) and area under the concentration-time curve (by 63%) of irbesartan, but these increases are not likely to be clinically significant. In summary, irbesartan has demonstrated minimal potential for drug or food interactions in trials conducted to date.
