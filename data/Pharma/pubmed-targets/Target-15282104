High-performance affinity chromatography was used to study the binding of phenytoin to an immobilized human serum albumin (HSA) column. This was accomplished through frontal analysis and competitive binding zonal elution experiments, the latter of which used four probe compounds for the major and minor binding sites of HSA injected into the presence of mobile phases containing known concentrations of phenytoin. It was found that phenytoin can interact with HSA at the warfarin-azapropazone, indole-benzodiazepine, tamoxifen, and digitoxin sites of this protein. The association constants for phenytoin at the indole-benzodiazepine and digitoxin sites were determined to be 1.04 (+/-0.05) x 10(4)M(-1) and 6.5 (+/-0.6) x 10(3)M(-1), respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. Both allosteric interactions and direct binding for phenytoin appear to take place at the warfarin-azapropazone and tamoxifen sites. This rather complex binding system indicates the importance of identifying the binding regions on HSA for specific drugs as a means for understanding the transport of such substances in blood and in characterizing their potential for drug-drug interactions.
