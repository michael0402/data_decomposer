Methylphenidate is an important stimulant prescribed to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. It has two chiral centers, but most current commercial formulations consist of the racemic mixture of the threo pair of methylphenidate isomers (d-, l-threo-methylphenidate). The d-isomer is the pharmacologically active component. Numerous studies reported that oral administration of the methylphenidate racemate undergoes first-pass, stereoselective clearance in humans with l-methylphenidate being eliminated faster than d-methylphenidate. Accordingly, the kinetics of hydrolysis of individual enantiomers by purified native and recombinant human liver carboxylesterases CES1A1 and CES2 and a colon isoenzyme CES3 were examined with a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry assay. The expression of CES1A1, CES2, and CES3 in Sf9 cells and the methods for purification of the three isoenzymes are reported. CES1A1 has a high catalytic efficiency for both d- and l-enantiomers of methylphenidate. No catalytic activity was detected with CES2 and CES3 for either enantiomer. The catalytic efficiency of CES1A1 for l-methylphenidate (k(cat)/K(m) = 7.7 mM(-1) min(-1)) is greater than that of d-methylphenidate (k(cat)/K(m) = 1.3-2.1 mM(-1) min(-1)). Hence, the catalytic efficiency of CES1A1 for methylphenidate enantiomers agrees with stereoselective clearance of methylphenidate reported in human subjects. Both enantiomers of methylphenidate can be fit into the three-dimensional model of CES1A1 to form productive complexes in the active site. We conclude that CES1A1 is the major enzyme responsible for the first-pass, stereoselective metabolism of methylphenidate.
