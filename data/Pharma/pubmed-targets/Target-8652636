The loop diuretic bumetanide which inhibits hepatic bile acid uptake competitively according to its transport kinetics has been proposed to serve as a substrate of a multispecific bile acid transport system in liver parenchymal cells. However, when the in vitro transcripts of two cloned hepatic bile acid uptake carriers, the Ntcp (Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide) and the oatp (organic anion transporting polypeptide), was expressed for three days in Xenopus laevis oocytes [3H]bumetanide uptake was not increased although bile acid uptake was stimulated. The data presented show that bumetanide is taken up by a third organic anion transport system which is different from the cloned bile acid transporters.
