PURPOSE: The effect of gemfibrozil is mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha). The objective of this study was to determine whether the lipid response to gemfibrozil therapy is influenced by the PPAR alpha-L162V polymorphism.
METHODS: Sixty-three abdominally obese men were randomly assigned to a 6-month-intervention program with either receiving a placebo (N = 31) or gemfibrozil (N = 32).
RESULTS: In response to gemfibrozil therapy, L162-homozygotes exhibited a 5.5% increase in high-density lipoprotein 2 cholesterol (HDL(2)-C) levels compared with a 50.0% increase among carriers of the V162 allele (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the HDL(2)-C response to gemfibrozil is modulated by the PPAR alpha-L162V polymorphism.
