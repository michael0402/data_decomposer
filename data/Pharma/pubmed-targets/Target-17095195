Over a 1-month period, a total of 16 ceftriaxone- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were isolated from 15 patients hospitalised at a burns intensive care unit (ICU). These isolates showed negative results for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) by the Vitek system and were highly resistant to ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefoxitin (minimum inhibitory concentrations > or =128 microg/mL). The bla(SHV-2a) and bla(DHA-1) genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles of the isolates were identical. AmpC disk tests for AmpC enzymes as well as double-disk tests and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) confirmatory disk tests for ESBLs yielded positive results for all the isolates. However, only three isolates (18.8%) were shown to produce ESBL by CLSI confirmatory tests using broth microdilution. We report the first outbreak of colonisations and infections due to K. pneumoniae isolates co-producing an SHV-2a ESBL and a DHA-1 AmpC beta-lactamase in a Korean hospital, which were suggested to represent a single clonal spread at a burns ICU. In addition, this report presents problems associated with ESBL detection using broth microdilution in isolates that co-produce an ESBL and an AmpC beta-lactamase.
