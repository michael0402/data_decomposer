The purpose of the present study was to determine antipsychotic doses that achieve 80% striatal dopamine D2-receptor occupancy for haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine in rats. Wistar rats were treated with normal saline vehicle (controls), haloperidol (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg/day), risperidone (3, 5 and 6 mg/kg/day) and olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days via osmotic minipumps. Striatal and cerebellar tissue were collected and in vivo dopamine D2-receptor occupancies were determined using 3H-raclopride. The doses required to achieve dopamine D2-receptor occupancy of 80% in 11- and 24-week old rats were: haloperidol 0.25 mg/kg/day, risperidone 5 mg/kg/day and olanzapine 10 mg/kg/day.
