During the Persian Gulf War, pyridostigmine bromide (PB), a reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, was used as prophylaxis against exposure to nerve gas. Exposure to PB has been suggested as a potential cause of the persistent fatigue reported among Gulf War veterans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute and continuous exposure to low doses of PB on the neuromuscular junction. Organotypic spinal cord-muscle cocultures were used to examine in vitro the effects of PB under controlled conditions. Acute exposure to PB potentiated neuromuscular activity. Continuous exposure to PB produced a progressive decrease in the contractile activity of muscle fibers. Ultrastructural examination by electron microscopy revealed no abnormalities in the neuromuscular junctions after 1 week of exposure. Nerve terminal degeneration and atrophy of the postjunctional folds were evident after 2-week exposure to low-dose PB. The effects of PB were reversible following withdrawal. The reversibility of the PB-induced changes in vitro suggests that such changes are causally unrelated to the fatigue reported by Persian Gulf War veterans years after exposure to PB.
