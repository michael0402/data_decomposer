A Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain expresses an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, GES-9, which differs from GES-1 by a Gly243Ser substitution, is inhibited by clavulanic acid and imipenem, and hydrolyzes aztreonam. The bla(GES-9) gene was located inside a class 1 integron structure containing two copies of a novel insertion sequence belonging to the IS1111 family.
