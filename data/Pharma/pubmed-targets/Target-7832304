BACKGROUND: Ropivacaine is a local anesthetic with a long duration of action. Although it is less toxic than bupivacaine, local anesthetic toxicity is possible when the plasma concentration is increased. Because ropivacaine is an amide-type local anesthetic, it is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (P450) in the liver, and its elimination and plasma concentration can be dependent on the level of P450. The purpose of this investigation was to elucidate the metabolism of ropivacaine by human hepatic P450.
METHODS: The metabolism of ropivacaine was compared using recombinant human and purified rat hepatic P450 isozymes. An inhibition study using antibodies against rat P450 was performed using hepatic microsomes from human and rat to identify which P450s are involved in ropivacaine metabolism.
RESULTS: Ropivacaine was metabolized to 2',6'-pipecoloxylidide (PPX), 3'-hydroxyropivacaine (3'-OH Rop), and 4'-hydroxyropivacaine (4'-OH Rop) by hepatic microsomes from human and rat. PPX was a major metabolite of both human and rat hepatic microsomes. In a reconstituted system with rat P450. PPX was produced by CYP2C11 and 3A2, 4'-OH Rop by CYP1A2, and 3'-OH Rop by CYP1A2 and 2D1. Formation of PPX in rat hepatic microsomes was inhibited by anti CYP3A2, but not by CYP2C11 antibody, and formation of 3'-OH Rop was inhibited by CYP1A2 and 2D1 antibodies. Anti CYP3A2 and 1A2 antibodies inhibited the formation of PPX and 3'-OH Rop in human hepatic microsomes, respectively. Recombinant human P450s expressed in lymphoblast cells were used for further study. CYP3A4 and 1A2 formed the most PPX and 3'-OH Rop, respectively. Ropivacaine N-dealkylation and 3'-hydroxylation activities correlated well with the level of CYP3A4 and 1A2 in human hepatic microsomes, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Ropivacaine was metabolized to PPX, 3'-OH Rop, and 4'-OH Rop by hepatic P450. PPX was a major metabolite in human hepatic microsomes. CYP3A4 was involved in producing PPX. CYP1A2 was involved in the formation of 3'-OH Rop in human hepatic microsomes.
