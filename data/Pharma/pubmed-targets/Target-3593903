The protein binding characteristics of prednisone and prednisolone were determined in human and rabbit plasma and in a 4.7 per cent human serum albumin (HSA) solution. The influence of prednisolone on prednisone binding in human plasma was also examined. Prednisolone exhibited nonlinear binding and prednisone linear binding characteristics in both human and rabbit plasma. Prednisone binding was not influenced by the presence of prednisolone. Prednisone binding to HSA was linear but to a degree substantially lower than observed in human plasma, suggesting the possibility that prednisone binds to other proteins in human plasma. The results support the hypothesis that the protein binding characteristics of prednisone and prednisolone do not explain the reported nonlinear pharmacokinetics of prednisone.
