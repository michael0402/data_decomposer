Latanoprost is an ester prodrug analogue of prostaglandin F2 alpha which effectively reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing uveoscleral outflow rather than altering conventional trabeculo-canalicular) aqueous outflow. The IOP-lowering effect of latanoprost lasts for 20 to 24 hours after a single dose, which allows a single daily dosage regimen. Data from 4 randomised double-masked multicentre studies indicate that a once daily dose of topical latanoprost 0.005% is as effective as timolol 0.5% twice daily in the treatment of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. A number of studies also demonstrate that latanoprost enhances IOP-lowering effects when applied in combination with other antiglaucoma agents. Latanoprost is well tolerated with no, or barely detectable, conjunctival hyperaemia, and, unlike timolol, is not associated with systemic adverse effects. However, 3 to 10% of patients treated with latanoprost 0.005% have shown increased iris pigmentation after 3 to 4.5 months' treatment. In summary, the available data show that latanoprost is a potent IOP-lowering agent with a number of positive features including a single daily dosage regimen, a novel mechanism of action that enhances the IOP-lowering effect of contemporary agents, and a lack of systemic adverse effects. These properties suitably poise latanoprost for a prominent position in the management of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.
