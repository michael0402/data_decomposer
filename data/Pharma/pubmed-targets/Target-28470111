Pharmacogenetics within psychiatry has the potential to aid in the dose and selection of medications. A substantial number of psychiatric medications are metabolized through either of the highly polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. Of these, clomipramine is subject to metabolism by both CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, leaving individuals with deficiencies of these drug-metabolizing enzymes at risk of higher concentrations of the parent molecule. Herein, we present the case of a 29-year-old male with diagnoses of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder who had trialed and failed a dozen psychiatric medications, many of which are subject to metabolism by CYP2D6 and/or CYP2C19, and had most recently been taking clomipramine for approximately 2.5 years. Pharmacogenetic testing revealed this patient to be an intermediate metabolizer for both CYP2C19 (*1/*2) and CYP2D6 (*4/*41), which resulted in considerably elevated serum trough concentrations of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine. This case provides a retrospective view of how the knowledge of an individual's pharmacogenetic test results can aid in their clinical care.
