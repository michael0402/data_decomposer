We have previously found that repeated exposure to heroin reduces liver synthesis of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and increases the production of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), which normally is not formed in the rat. By contrast repeated exposure to naltrexone does not activate M6G synthesis but increases the V(max) of M3G formation. M3G synthesis depends on the activity of two isoforms of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), UGT1A1 and UGT2B1. These isozymes also activate the formation of estradiol-3-glucuronide (E3G) and estradiol-17-glucuronide (E17G), respectively. The goal of the present study was to investigate the role of UGT1A1 and UGT2B1 in the effects of heroin and naltrexone by determining their influence on the synthesis of E3G and E17G. Estradiol glucuronidation was performed using microsomes of rats treated daily, for 10 days, with saline, heroin (10mg/kg, i.p.), or naltrexone (40mg/kg, i.p.). Moreover, liver expression of both UGT1A1 and UGT2B1 was studied in the same experimental conditions by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Kinetic analysis showed that the V(max) for E3G formation was significantly reduced by both heroin (168.82+/-9.73nmol/mg/min) and naltrexone (194.60+/-16.6) relative to saline (624.60+/-17.6). Moreover, homotropic kinetic of E3G formation (Hill coefficient: 1.8) was transformed in Michaelis-Menten kinetic by both heroin (0.88) and naltrexone (1.15). The synthesis of E17G was not affected by either opioid. The expression of liver UGT1A1 and UGT2B1 did not differ across groups. The present results suggest that heroin and naltrexone can reduce estradiol glucuronidation via a specific interaction with UGT1A1 isoform.
