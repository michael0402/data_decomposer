Palonosetron (Aloxi(R), Onicit(R)) is a potent, single stereoisomeric 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist developed to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The pharmacokinetics and metabolic disposition of a single intravenous [(14)C]-palonosetron (10 microg/kg, 0.8 microCi/kg) bolus dose were evaluated in six healthy volunteers (three males, three females) using serial blood, plasma, urine and fecal samples obtained over 10 days. The safety, tolerability and cardiac effects were assessed. Radiolabeled metabolic characterization revealed that unchanged palonosetron accounted for 71.9% of the total radioactivity in plasma over 96 h, with an extensive distribution volume (8.34 l/kg) and mean plasma elimination half-life of 37 h. Approximately 83% of the dose was recovered in urine ( approximately 40% as unchanged drug, with 50% metabolized; M9 and M4 were the major metabolites) and 3.4% in feces. Hydrolysis of urine samples suggests that the metabolites are not beta-glucuronide or sulfate conjugates of the parent drug or metabolites. The blood to plasma concentration ratio of the total radioactivity was 1.2, on average, indicating little selective partitioning in erythrocytes. Palonosetron was generally well tolerated; headache was the most frequently reported adverse event. Electrocardiograms and 72 h Holter monitoring revealed no clinically significant changes. Palonosetron circulates in plasma mainly as the parent drug. Renal elimination is the primary excretion route, with parent drug and metabolites M9 and M4 accounting for the majority of palonosetron disposition. These results indicate that both renal and hepatic routes are involved in the elimination of palonosetron from the body.
