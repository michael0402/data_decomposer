      "system_answer": "The sub-queries did not provide specific information regarding the interaction between Flumazenil and benzodiazepines when administered before or with them. Therefore, I will provide a general explanation based on existing knowledge.\n\nFlumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. It works by competitively inhibiting the action of benzodiazepines at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex. Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA, leading to sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects.\n\nWhen Flumazenil is administered before or with benzodiazepines, it can block or reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. This means that Flumazenil can be used to counteract benzodiazepine overdoses or to reverse their sedative effects after procedures. However, its use must be carefully managed, as it can precipitate withdrawal symptoms in individuals dependent on benzodiazepines and may lead to seizures, especially if other proconvulsant drugs are involved.\n\nIn summary, Flumazenil interacts with benzodiazepines by blocking their effects at the receptor level, which can reverse sedation and other effects of benzodiazepines when administered before or with them.",

This modification is a specific chemical interaction, whereas Lepirudin, as described in the drugbank-drug table, is produced via yeast cells and involves a substitution of leucine for isoleucine at the N-terminal end and the absence of a sulfate group on tyrosine, representing a different type of molecular modification.",
