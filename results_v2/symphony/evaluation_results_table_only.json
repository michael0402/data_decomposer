      "system_answer": "Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Its mechanism of action involves binding to the extracellular domain of EGFR, thereby inhibiting the receptor's activation. This prevents the receptor from binding to its natural ligands, leading to the inhibition of downstream signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival. By blocking these pathways, Cetuximab can help to slow down or stop the growth of cancer cells that overexpress EGFR.",
