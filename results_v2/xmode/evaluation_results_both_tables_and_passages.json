      "question": "How does the development of second-generation antihistamines address the adverse effects associated with first-generation agents, and how does this compare with the descriptions of biotech drugs?",
      "gt_answer": "Second-generation antihistamines such as desloratadine, fexofenadine, and levocetirizine were developed to reduce adverse effects, particularly CNS-related ones, which were more common with first-generation agents. This is achieved through high selectivity for the H(1) receptor and minimal drug-drug interactions. In contrast, biotech drugs listed in the drugbank-drug table, such as Etanercept and Cetuximab, have complex mechanisms and targets, potentially leading to more varied side effects.",
      "system_answer": "Second-generation antihistamines were developed to minimize adverse effects like sedation and cardiac issues seen in first-generation agents. Biotech drugs are characterized by their targeted action and ability to overcome drug resistance.\n\nSecond-generation antihistamines such as desloratadine, fexofenadine, and levocetirizine are highly selective for the H(1) receptor, have limited CNS effects, and show minimal drug-drug interactions. They do not impair cognitive or psychomotor functioning and are comparable to placebo in terms of somnolence. Biotech drugs, like temozolomide and dasatinib, are used in targeted therapies and have mechanisms to overcome drug resistance, such as inhibiting efflux transporters or targeting specific pathways.",
