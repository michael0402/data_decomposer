        "gt_answer": "Flumazenil is used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine sedation and is typically administered intravenously due to its low oral bioavailability. In contrast, Lepirudin, another drug listed in the \"drugbank-drug\" table, is a liquid form that Bayer ceased producing in 2012. While the passage discusses Flumazenil's role and preferred administration route, the table provides details about Lepirudin's state and production history.",
        "system_answer": "Flumazenil is used as a benzodiazepine antagonist to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, often in cases of overdose or anesthesia recovery. It is administered intravenously. Lepirudin, also administered intravenously, serves as an anticoagulant, particularly in cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. While both drugs are given intravenously, their clinical roles are distinctly different, with Flumazenil reversing sedation effects and Lepirudin functioning as an anticoagulant.",

Denileukin diftitox, in contrast, is a fusion protein used in cancer treatment that combines interleukin-2 with diphtheria toxin. It targets cells expressing the IL-2 receptor, delivering the toxin to these cells, and inducing cell death. The mechanisms of action of these two drugs are fundamentally different: Flumazenil acts on the central nervous system to reverse sedation, while Denileukin diftitox targets and kills specific cancer cells.",

This is achieved through high selectivity for the H(1) receptor and minimal drug-drug interactions.

        "system_answer": "The development of second-generation antihistamines primarily addresses the adverse effects of first-generation agents, such as sedation and anticholinergic effects. This is achieved by reducing the ability of these drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby decreasing sedation and cognitive impairment. These agents also offer longer duration of action for once-daily dosing, enhancing compliance and minimizing adverse effects associated with frequent dosing. In contrast, biotech drugs, which include complex biological molecules such as proteins and monoclonal antibodies, have highly specific mechanisms of action and target specific pathways or cells. They are used for a wide range of conditions and require complex manufacturing processes. While second-generation antihistamines focus on minimizing sedation and optimizing dosing, biotech drugs are developed with different therapeutic goals and production processes.",

Diclofenac, however, is known to work by inhibiting COX enzymes, which is not directly related to the targets listed in the tables.",

Diclofenac's mechanism of action relates to these targets by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes, specifically targeting the PGHS isozymes, similar to etodolac, which shows selectivity for PGHS-2.",
