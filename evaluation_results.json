      "system_answer": "Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that works by targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of cancer cells. By binding to EGFR, cetuximab inhibits the receptor's activation and subsequent signaling pathways, which can lead to reduced tumor growth and proliferation. Cetuximab is marketed under the brand name Erbitux.",

It is primarily used in individuals with cystic fibrosis to manage the accumulation of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes during inflammatory responses to infections.",
